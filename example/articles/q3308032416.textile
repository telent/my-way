Charles Stewart has <a

>CLRFI Snippets</a>.  I think it's good that the CLRFI process has
visibility (i.e. that people are saying "this should be a CLRFI"
instead of "this should be in the next revision of the standard"), but
writing a decent proposal is a lot more work than simply suggesting
one should be written, and even getting constructive feedback has been
a battle.  My previous experience has been - to paraphrase Ghandhi's
oft-quoted saying - that <a

>first they argue with you about the package name</a>, <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=87adcklr4f.fsf%40noetbook.telent.net&rnum=2"
>then they take your text and use it without attribution</a>.  If
stage 3 is "then you win", we haven't reached that just yet.
