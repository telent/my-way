<p> Well, that was an experience.  For the benefit of Google, to get
XFree 4.1.0 running on a Debian GNU/Linux new-world Imac, I needed
(1) not to use the kernel framebuffer support, because the kernel is
determined to use the OpenFirmware console, which is apparently not
much cop, (2) to configure for 1024x786 at 75Hz, because any other
resolution results in a black screen (the power button goes orange, so
I guess this is DPMS cutting in) with no explanation, and (3) that the 
<tt>XkbModel</tt> should be <tt>macintosh_old</tt>, contrary to what
the debconf thing says.

<p>In the spirit of cargo cult configuration file hacking (and when has Xkb been
anything else?) I reproduce the revelant sectionn here

<pre>
Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier      "Generic Keyboard"
        Driver          "keyboard"
        Option          "CoreKeyboard"
        Option          "XkbRules"      "xfree86"
        Option          "XkbModel"      "macintosh_old"
        Option          "XkbLayout"     "ma"
        Option "XkbTypes"        "default"
        Option   "XkbCompat"       "default"
        Option   "XkbSymbols"      "macintosh/us"
        Option   "XkbGeometry"     "macintosh"
EndSection
</pre>

<p> I spent as long working this out as it used to take to calculate
modelines back in the bad old X386 days.  Yay progress!
