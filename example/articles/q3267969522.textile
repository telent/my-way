<blockquote>
Words and symbols will pose no problems and a three-dimensional shape
can be represented by a two-dimensional drawing.  However, there are
some interesting cases regarding trade marks for sounds and smells.  At
present it is clear that whatever the trade mark, its representation
must fit into an 8 cm by 8 cm box on the application form.
