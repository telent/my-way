<p> Complete lack of diary entries for the past week demonstrates
quite clearly that I've not been on trains much recently.

<p> Sunbury project finished for the year.  Lisp web project (the
thing I needed UncommonSQL for) also substantially finished and
waiting for installation 'at risk' time to be scheduled.  Time to do
some free software again, and this time it's SBCL PPC.

<p>Convinced myself that the <a href="/sbcl-internals/pseudo-atomic"
>pseudo-atomic</a> mechanism does work after all.  Unusually, it uses
two registers: ALLOC says whether we're in a PA section, NL3 says
whether it was interrupted.  At end of PA section, we add NL3 (which
is a big number) to ALLOC, then conditionally trap to the
run-pending-signal code if ALLOC is big enough to be negative.  Don't
yet see <i>why</i> we need two registers, though.  Don't know what
happens if we get a signal in foreign code either, but I doubt that's
allowed inside a PA section.  NL3 is $6, ALLOC is $17

<p>Which is nice to know, but doesn't get us any closer to solving the
actual bug we're currently seeing.
