<p>More work on-and-off on this texinfo stuff, mostly in
laptop-battery-sized chunks in Borders.  I was doing quite well, too,
until I found an open (by design) wireless AP accessible from the
Borders cafe on Oxford St, but now I find I'm still within reach of
the net I think I'm going to go and read a book instead.

<p>What did you want to know?  It kinda sorta works for producing
grotty HTML from the texinfo I happen to have lying around, but there
are big chunks still to do before it's going to be any use to anyone,
and it's entirely non-obvious to me how it's going to be usefully
customised.  There's a TRANSLATE-ELEMENT gf specialised on a
OUTPUT-TRANSLATOR, so you can always subclass my HTML-TRANSLATOR with
your SPIFFY-HTML-TRANSLATOR, but it remains to be seen whether that's
going to be any actual use.  This is very definitely written with that
particular variety of iterative design known as "no design", which is
fun but whether it turns out to be any use I can't say yet.

<p>I guess I should at least add support for @menu and for the
up/down/next/prev links.
