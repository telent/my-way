Quiet lately.  Writing English prose is just not as exciting as code -
especially when it's either a conference paper or a C.V. (US: resum√©)
update.  Yes, time to find more paid stuff.

<p>Last night it was pointed out to me that the lyric I'd been hearing
for the last 4 years as "He's got an ice lolly" 
(Propellerheads,
Velvet Pants, <i>Decksandrumsandrockandroll</i>) probably in fact
doesn't say that at all.  Hmm.  Still sounds like it to <i>me</i>, though.
