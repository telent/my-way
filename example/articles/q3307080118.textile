I call that a successful weekend.  As previously reported, I have a
working computer at home again.  The ubuntu default desktop lasted
about two hours before I reverted to my old sawfish/xterm ways: I have
a real reason and a rationalisation for this, which are respectively
(a) it was taking over a minute to start emacs at login and I couldn't
see why; (b) I wanted to bind the key labelled 'Ctrl' to Super,
instead of to Caps Lock, and couldn't see an option in the
configuration doodads.  Turns out the emacs problem was probably
because I had localhost as 128.0.0.1 in /etc/hosts: I have no
<i>idea</i> how that happened.

<p>Still and all, I managed to dust off the sbcl amd64 port and start
to page the details back into my brain.  Assuming I'm hacking on the
right version, I may even have something to commit (define-instruction
forms for various sse instructions we need, albeit currently with
slightly dodgy^W^Wmassively broken disassemblies) today or tomorrow.

<p>In other news,  I am mostly not lame any more.  Spent an hour or so
on Sunday skating in slow gentle circles around the shallow end of 
<a href="http://www.citiskate.co.uk/skatersmap.htm" >Serpentine
Road</a>: as long as I don't try doing anything complicated with the
left leg, it's manageable.
