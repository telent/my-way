<p>Some aspects of CLX are deeply tedious to experiment with, because
changing them requires hacking around with macros, then you need to
rebuild all of CLX to make it notice the macro definitions have
changed.

<p>But still, after a couple of pints I don't care quite as much

<p>Here's a <a href="/clim-address-book.png">screenshot</a> (which I
admit is dull and ugly and when will CLIM hackers learn that picking a
font other than Courier is 80% of the work of producing kewl
screeenshots) showing McCLIM running in SBCL/native threads.  Some
work is still needed: it busy-waits. CLX has some <i>horrible</i>
