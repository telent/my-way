<p> I discovered last night that <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/"
>gpg</a> has an alternate output mode which is intended to be
machine-parseable, so I've just committed some exciting new breakage
to SBCL's <a href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf-install"
>asdf-install</a> contrib to make it a bit smarter about checking GPG
signatures.  It now attempts to check signatures for all packages no
matter where they've come from, but there are restarts to bypass most
of the checks.

<p>A package may

<ul>
<li> have no gpg signature at all
<li> be signed by a gpg key you don't have on your keyring
<li> be signed by a key on your keyring but which you don't have a trust
   relationship with (i.e. nobody you know has signed it)
<li> be signed by a trusted key, but not be on the list of package
   suppliers (after all, just because you trust someone is who they say they
   are, you might not want to install their lisp software)
</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two of these are presently terminal errors, the third can
be ignored, and the fourth has a restart that lets you add the
packager to your package supplier list.  The package supplier list is
stored between sessions in <tt>~/.sbcl/trusted-uids.lisp</tt>

<p> This is an incompatible change: cue evil laughter.
