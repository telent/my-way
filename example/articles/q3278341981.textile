I'm not sure exactly what to write here, but I feel an urge to whinge
a bit about the IT job market in the UK right now.  Translations:

<p>If they say <b>Unix</b>, they mean <b>enterprise</b> or <b>ISP</b>
sysadmin experience: Veritas, EMC, clustering, etc.

<p>If they say <b>C</b>, they mean <b>embedded</b> or they mean <b>C++</b>.

<p>If they say <b>OOD</b>, they also mean <b>C++</b>.

<p>If they say <b>threads</b>, they mean <b>pthreads</b>.

<p>If they say <b>Java</b>, they mean <b>J2EE</b>.

<p>If they say <b>Perl</b>, they mean <b>entry level</b>.

<p>I don't think anyone has said <b>Lisp</b> yet, but when they do,
they mean <b>AI</b>.

<p>Do I sound bitter?  Very well, then, I sound bitter.
