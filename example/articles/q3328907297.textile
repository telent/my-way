Random notes on the CLIM layout protocol, as implemented in McCLIM.

<ul>
<li> attempting to override the size of a stream pane (by calling
<tt>change-space-requirements</tt> on it) is probably a bad idea: at
any rate, it doesn't work.  Let the internal clim magic work out the
sizes of these things based on the stuff that you've printed to them,
and if you need to constrain them to a given size, drop them in a
scroller or (possibly, haven't tried) a restraining-pane.

<li> setting the :scroll-bars option on a stream pane is not the same
as putting it in a scroller.  Indeed, I can't see from the spec how the 
:scroll-bars stuff is even supposed to work - do the
:height/:width/etc keywords apply to the visible area or to the inner
stream pane?

</ul>

As you may have guessed from the preceding, largely undirected climacs
hacking continues.
