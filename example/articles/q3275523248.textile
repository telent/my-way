This space reserved for a rant about Knoppix; specifically, how in the
hell is anybody supposed to reliably find all the source code for the
packages it's composed of - especially when it's based on Debian
<i>testing</i> given that (as far as I know) there's no requirement on
a Debian mirror to keep all previous versions of testing around
indefinitely in case Knoppix users want the sources they're entitled
to.  Given how much of this stuff is GPLed, the commercial
distributors (if not Knopper himself) are going to have a pretty
unpleasant time of it when RMS finds out.

<P>apt-get on the filesystem which will one day be the cirCLe CD
(rather, disc 1 of the two disc circle cd set) has just decided it
wants to upgrade over 100Mb of stuff.  So, whether it will still
actually work when it's burnt to CD, who knows?
