<p>What I should be doing: hacking on CLiki to allow two cliki instances
to share the same pages (and the same methods for
search-term-relevance and the rest), so that we can have multiple
`skins' for the same data.

<P>Yes, I'm sure that's theoretically possible with CSS.  The prospect
of making any CSS solution work on IE5 and Netscape 4 is neither warm
nor fuzzy, though.

<p>What I'm doing instead: fixing the SBCL condition-variable bugs
that Gilbert found.  I attempt to justify this to myself by claiming
that my productivity will take a leap when <a

Hemlock</a> gets good enough to dump ILISP.
