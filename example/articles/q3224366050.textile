<p> Something odd happened to the new sourceforge mail archive
interface and I don't know what.  The latest messages available in it
seem to be getting gradually older and older

<p>Oh well

<p>Lisp news: <a
href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/12820/0/8017609/"
>new asdf version</a> with extra <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cclan/asdf/"
>silly functions</a> to help cclan package maintainers build their packages.
<a href="http://ww.telent.net/lisp/free-the-x3j-thirteen/2002.02.html"
>New ftx13</a>

<p>Non-lisp news: passed my driving test, yesterday (i.e. Monday)
morning.  Some theories claim that this means I am no longer eligible
to hack on SBCL.

<p>Tomorrow, I hope, vendor-neutral cclan packages for Araneida,
db-sockets, possibly also cliki.  The plan requires getting some work
done too, so we'll see ...
