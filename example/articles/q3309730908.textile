texinfo.lisp, albeit not in any particularly useful form yet.
<pre>
CL-USER> (read-info-file "/export/home/dan/src/sourceforge/cclan/asdf/asdf.texinfo")

#&lt;INFO-NODE {9CDD449}> is an instance of class #&lt;STANDARD-CLASS INFO-NODE>.
The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
 BODY    ((("?" "chapter")) "Error handling
"
          (("?" "findex")) "SYSTEM-DEFINITION-ERROR
"
          (("?" "findex")) "OPERATION-ERROR

It is an error to define a system incorrectly: an implementation may
detect this and signal a generalised instance of
"
          ((:CODE "SYSTEM-DEFINITION-ERROR")) ".

Operations may go wrong (for example when source files contain
errors).  These are signalled using generalised instances of
"
          ((:CODE "OPERATION-ERROR")) ".

")
 MENU    "unbound"
 UP      "Top"
 PREV    "The object model of asdf"
 NEXT    "Compilation error and warning handling"
 NAME    "Error handling"
; No value
</pre>

Still have to do conditionals, macro definition and alias stuff, plus
there's a ton of work left adding definitions for uninteresting
commands, then I need to think of some way to get the data <i>out</i>
into one or more useful formats.  Said formats will almost certainly
include HTML (yes, I know about texi2html; no, it does not produce the
kind of HTML that I want), and I may even do a CLIM backend too.
