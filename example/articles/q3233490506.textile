I don't know why, but it appears that <a
href="http://spamassassin.taint.org." >spamassassin</a> has no
<tt>blacklist_to</tt> command.  I'd find this very useful as I have
old addresses which I still need to check because they're published in
various places, but which I haven't used otherwise in the last four
years, and still get a steady stream of spam.

<p>If you're using spamassassin through your .forward file, though<sup>*</sup> -
or presumably also procmail - it's easy to fake

<pre>
header SENT_TO_DETACHED To =~ /dan\@detached.demon.co.uk/
score SENT_TO_DETACHED 3.5
</pre>

That should tip the balance a little.

<p><sup>*</sup> apparently this doesn't work if you use spamd/spamc
because it won't pick up new rules from the user_prefs file in that
case.  This is a shame if so, because I really do need to convert to a
daemon-based approach - currently I get massive thrashing and load
averages exceeding 15 when I reintroduce my laptop to the net after
having been away.  A fix would be nice.
