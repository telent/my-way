Araneida 0.9 released.  From the NEWS file:
<pre>
* Portability to multiple lisps:
  - SBCL, as before
  - OpenMCL, threaded handlers only
  - Allegro, threaded handlers only
  - Armed Bear Common Lisp, threaded handlers only
  - CMUCL, serve-event only
  - CLISP, serve-event only
  - LispWorks, threaded (from Jochen Schmidt, based on Portable AServe)

In particular the CLISP support is a bit of a hack; timeouts are still
notably missing, and you must run (araneida:host-serve-events) after
you're done running start-listener on all of your listeners.

(Brian Mastenbrook, Jochen Schmidt)

* SERVE-EVENT fixes so that non-Araneida fd handlers can be
  added/removed during request handling.  More than slightly kludgey,
  and less than entirely thread-safe, but this can be blamed mostly on
  the nature of serve-event.  (Brian again, and Luis Oliveira)
