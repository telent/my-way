<p>More RSS fun.  Apparently weblog rss feeds should have items in
reverse chronological order, just like the weblogs they syndicate.
So, I switched mine around.  Also added the first sentence of each
item as the item title: this will fall down in cases where my rather
poor heuristics for detecting sentences, or in entries where my
inverted pyramid has overbalanced.  Apologies to anyone using an RSS
client which will therefore decide that these are all brand new
entries and make them read all my old entries again.

<p>If anyone would like to recommend a GUI RSS aggregator for Linux
that's not (a) Straw, or (b) Emacs-based, please feel free.  There's
nothing particularly wrong with Straw, but I worry whether the
debugging messages it spits out from time to time are caused by
problems with it or problems with my rss.
