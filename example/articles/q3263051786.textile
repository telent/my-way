Installed <a

>Firebird 0.6</a>, and it seems to have fixed the weird problem with
hyphens and apostrophes that (on some but not all web pages) would
cause 0.5'
<br> irritating, but I never found out whether it was a
phoenix problem, a mozilla problem, a debian packaging problem, a font
problem, a locale problem, or frankly, what.  Which is why, if anyone
associated with the mozilla project is reading this, i didn't report
it to them.  Anyway, if anyone else on the planet was suffering that
one, 0.6 is the cure.  Now I can read <a
