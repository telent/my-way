Sigh.  I checked my mail this afternoon to find that judging by the
number of bounces in it, someone is spamming with my name in the From
address.  If you have mail from me that doesn't look like something I
would typically have sent, look at the headers.  Unless it was sent
from 81.103.195.118 or 64.49.254.81, it probably wasn't anything I
wrote.

<p>I guess it's time to start routinely GPG-signing all the email I
send.  1024 bit DSA key, id 75908913, accept no substitutes.
