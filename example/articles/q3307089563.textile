<b>Cl&eacute; RIB validation</b>

This may not be so interesting to most of my usual readers, but is
added here in the hope that (a) Google will find it, (b) French Google
users will be able to understand it.  The French banking system has a
thing called "Pr&eacute;l&eacute;vement Automatique", which is
essentially an authority for a third party to help themselves to your
bank account at regular intervals.  UK readers will recognise it as a
Direct Debit; I'm sure other countried have similar things.  To to set
this up you need 23 characters of bank codes (5 char code banque, 5
char code guichet, 11 char numero de compte, 2 digits cl&eacute;) ,
and it turns out that the last two of them are a checksum.  I spent a
while looking around web pages written in languages I have no
particularly good grasp of (French, VB, PHP, some Clipper/Foxpro
thing) looking for details on how to calculate it, and eventually
transliterated a PHP example to arrive at the following:

<pre>
create or replace function fr_calculate_cle(varchar,varchar,varchar) 
returns char(2) as '
declare
        code_banque ALIAS FOR $1;
        code_guichet ALIAS FOR $2;
        num_compte ALIAS FOR $3;
        instring TEXT;
        cle integer;
begin
        instring = translate(lower($1||$2||$3),
                             ''abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'',
                             ''12345678912345678912345678'');
        cle := 62*to_number(substr(instring,1,7),''9999999'');
        cle := cle+ 34*to_number(substr(instring,8,7),''9999999'');
        cle := cle+ 3*to_number(substr(instring,15,7),''9999999'');
        return substr(to_char(97-(cle % 97),''00''),2);
end
' language 'plpgsql';
</pre>

If there's any better way to make postgres output a 2 digit zero-padded
number without a leading space, I want to hear about it.
