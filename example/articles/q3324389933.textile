I bought a new mp3 player.  This has nothing (afaik) to do with Lisp,
but I thought I'd note it anyway, if only to pacify the end-of-month
bug.

<p>This reminds me that I never did write the <a href=
"http://ww.telent.net/diary/2004/7/#4.78600">review I promised</a> of
my last foray into portable music devices, so here it is: "The Synn
{something or other} is cheap in both senses.  It ate batteries
faster than my portable CD player - an impressive feat for something
with no moving parts - and after a few months of intermittent use it
developed a hiss in the left channel that was so loud it made the
music unlistenable".

<p>I hope to have better luck with the Creative Zen Micro.
