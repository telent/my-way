This is probably my last post from Oxford.  At least, last from this
house in Oxford: I'm sure I'll be visiting Oxford again in the near
future, and someday I might even want to move back, but this
particular episode is over.  

<p>So far I have 
<ul>
<li>lots of stuff in boxes, in a van
<li>lots of stuff in boxes, to go in the van
<li>some amount of other stuff, to go in boxes, to go in the van
<li>lost (probably packed) the Allen key that I need to take the bookcase apart
<li>still not done most of the cleaning and vacuuming that I had
planned to do about six hours ago
</ul>

All things considered, really I should stop reading mail, turn the
remaining computers off, and get on with it.

<p>A moderately long post about Havoc's
Linux-desktop-should-standardise-on-java document may follow (I
disagree, which should come as no surprise to regular readers).  I've
had time to think about it but no time to write yet.
