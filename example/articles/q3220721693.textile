 <p> Everything is on hold.  Replacement driving test not until March,
phone won't be repaired for a couple of days, local computer shop
refuse to sell me memory when I tell them it's for a Mac (so,
mail-ordered it, so not here yet), guitar shop sold someone else the
guitar I wanted to buy and due to the NAMM show probably won't be
getting another for a couple of weeks.  At least I succeeded in
getting a haircut.
