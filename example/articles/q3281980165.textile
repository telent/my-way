I lied.  Well, I was mistaken: in the course of tidying up purify so
that I might understand it, I managed to break it.  <tt>!(a &&
!b)</tt> is <i>not</i>, De Morgan will happily tell you, the same
thing as <tt>(!a && b)</tt>.  Doh.  I was copying a whole bunch of
stuff (constant boxed vectors, or possibly unboxed inconstant vectors)
to static space that should have been happy in read-only space.  So
static space was up to 9.5Mb from its normal 5, hence the extra time
spent checking it.  If it takes an approximate extra 10s to GC when
there's an extra 5Mb of static space to check, this also goes some way
to explain why CMUCL is faster: in 18e it only has 2.5Mb of static
space, so that's 5s off the GC time, leading us to predict that it
should take about 15s.  It's actually a bit under (13s) but that's
only a couple of seconds still to claw back, then.

<p>All times are to execute <tt>(time (dotimes (i 400) (gc)))</tt>
