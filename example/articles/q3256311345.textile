To those of my readers who don't as a matter of course go on and check
Shaver's diary and links therefrom

I might add that pervasive use of getters/setters feels a lot less
ugly in a language where the syntax to update an attribute looks just
like a method call anyway -

<pre>
(creditcard-number my-card) => "4123412341234129" ; a slot read
(creditcard-type my-card) => "VISA"               ; a function call
(setf (creditcard-number my-card) "5455555555555555") ; a slot write
(setf (creditcard-type my-card) "mastercard")     ; an error
;;; ... but, oh, look
(creditcard-type my-card) => "Mastercard"         ; it already knew
</pre>

Actually, I lied.  The particular system I took those examples from
uses MOPpery to store all its data in a Postgres database anyway, so
<i>none</i> of the above is necessarily a straightforward assignment
under the covers.

<p>Actually, I lied twice.  Those aren't my (or, as far as I know,
anybody's) real credit card numbers either.  Sorry, folks.
