Upgraded the CLiki version on <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/">www.cliki.net</a> to 0.4.1; now we can
have page names with dots in them.  Also re-enabled posting for
everyone other than A N Other; not that that will dissuade anyone who
really wants to mess it up, but 90% of A N Other's content seems to be
from people who don't care a lot whether they mess it up or not.
