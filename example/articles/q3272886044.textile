<p>Item (2) below (logically above) turns out to be a problem in the
garbage collector and not at all a library bug.  We weren't scavenging
signal contexts (and thus registers) when they were on alternate
signal stacks.  Most threads don't spend a lot of time in alternate
signal stacks, so you have to work the GC fairly hard to see this.
Fixed now, anyway.

<p>There still seems to be some bug which I haven't found, where the
GCing thread will occasionally overcount the number of threads it's
signalled to stop, and then sit in a loop indefinitely waiting for a
thread that doesn't exist.
