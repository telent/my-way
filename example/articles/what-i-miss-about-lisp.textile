title: What I miss most about Lisp

It's been three months since I wrote anything longer than one line in
Lisp, and over a year since I wrote more than a screenful of the
stuff.  

What I miss most is not CLOS or the REPL or even macros (per se,
anyway).  It's 

* the distinction between READ and EVAL: a sane syntax for
  constructing complex data structures that look like code, but
  without actually having the data structures in question interpreted

* and backtraces with the values of function parameters in them.  When
  you're doing the same thing 1000 times to different database rows or
  objects in a collection, and one of them has a @nil@ in it
  somewhere, it would be really nie to know *which* one.

And maybe the REPL (although irb does most of that).  And kinda sorta
Defsystem, but I seem to be in the process of "reimplementing that":https://github.com/telent/projectr ...

But I hope soon to get Rubinius installed, just because I still have
the irrational opinion that a grown-up programming language ought to
be able to implemet itself (and I have a /thing/ for native code) so
project 1 there is to see if I can hack the backtrace thingy at least
into it.
