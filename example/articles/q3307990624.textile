MORE TRIVIAL!

(with-server (s (:port 8913 :reuse-address t))
   (loop
    (with-open-stream (c (accept-connection s)) 
        (read-line c)
        (format c "This is a compliant though pointless implementation 
of the finger protocol~%"))))
</pre>

<p>Presently only implemented for SBCL, and doesn't handle errors yet.
I'm going to sleep now, so please feel free to grab it from CVS and
fix either or both of these omissions before I next get a chance.
