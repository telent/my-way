I have nothing to do this weekend.  That's not actually true; there
are lots of things I could be doing, and I'm ignoring all of them in
favour of a mostly unbroken 4-day sbcl amd64 hacking stint.

<p>(Took break for skating on Friday; stopping also for skating again
on Sunday afternoon, and possibly later this afternoon for cleaning
the bearings in the skates if I can figure out how to get them out of
the wheels)

<p>In the meantime, no real news yet.  Spent the first day and a half
of my four day hackathon trying to figure out whatstate I'd laft the
tree in last time.
