title: Debian has defeated me once again

Debian has defeated me once again.  I have the ambition, one day, of
doing a fresh standard debian install that doesn't involve stopping
halfway through to monkey with modules or an unsupported PXE or
untarring the base system where it's not supposed to be and using a
chroot or ... 

<p>Today's alpha install has not satisfied that ambition.  I can't
make the machine boot the unstable rc2 debian-installer netinst image
from CD, so I had to do a floppy install.  <i>It's 2005 and I just had
to buy a new box of floppies - how wrong is that? </i> There isn't, as
far as I can see, any floppy images newer than woody for Debian Alpha,
so I ended up installing that and apt-get upgrading.  It still hasn't
reached the point where I find out whether the SATA controller is
recognised, because it's still building the 2.6 kernel that I hope
will contain the relevant driver.

<p>In the process of writing this entry, I just realised that I forgot
to apply the -ac patch to said kernel before building it.  Bother.
