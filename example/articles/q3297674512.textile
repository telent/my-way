To pacify the end-of-month bug, here is another placeholder.  Without
going into any particularly interesting details, this one says that

<ul>
<li> There's enough of a mess in the SBCL AMD64 backend regarding
floating point (mostly to do with object sizes and alignment) that
it'd be quicker and more reliable to actually go over it carefully and
check it all at once instead of fixing bugs as they happen.  That
being so, this would be a great opportunity to rewrite it to use XMM
registers and the "128 bit media instructions" instead of the x87.
AMD claims that they run faster,there are 16 random-access registers
instead of the slightly weird x87 stack thing, and it has perfectly
normal IEEE single and double precision (none of this 80 bit nonsense)
so we might even get less freaky results too.

<li> I've decided to enter the London Inline Marathon in September, so
am now skating to work three days a week (or so; depends on weather
etc).  There was a tube (metro train system) strike here in London
yesterday; so I ended up skating to work, across town to the <a
href="http://www.londonskate.com/start.php?uid=21" >Londonskate</a> (a
and less confusingly k.a the Wednesday Night Skate), did the skate
itself, and then, finding that the tube was still closed after the pub
shut, skated back across town to Liverpool St station from where I got
a surface rail train to Stratford (the one in East London, not the one
where Shakespeare lived) and skated home from there.  Probably around
20-22 miles in all, I guess, and must admit that today I am just a
little tired.
