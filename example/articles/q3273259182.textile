Half the known world have probably linked to this already:

Some people read it as a personal endorsement of PHP, VB, and other
semi-baked programming languages.  Actually my personal preference is
a much darker, uglier, and more shameful secret: Common Lisp, CLOS,
plus an ML-like type inferencing compiler/error checker (with some
things done in a sublanguage with Haskell semantics and Lisp syntax).
Common Lisp dates from around 1982 and ML from 1984.

<p>I try to keep this preference concealed from young people who've been
raised on a diet of C, Java, C#, Perl, etc.  They just wouldn't find
it credible that 20-year-old systems and ideas are actually better
than the latest and greatest from Microsoft and Sun.

To be honest, I find his protestations a little unconvincing.  Just
