<p>Enough about Emacs 21.  I think it's staying.

<p> Last Saturday I rented <i>Soylent Green</i> on video, and didn't
actually get as far as watching it becuase it turned out that
<i>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</i> was on, then when that finished
that <i>Brazil</i> was following it.

<p> <i>Brazil</i> is seriously excellent, by the way.

<p> Having failed to return the video on time anyway, I decided I
might as well watch it.  Not altogether impressed; it all seems a
little implausible.  If there are 40m people in New York, they can't
all be remarkably well-nourished and living in apartments the size of
the one that Charlton Heston got - that's bigger than my flat in
London was.  

<p>It's hard to be significantly immersed in net "culture"(sic)
without learning how this film ends even if you never see it, so I
can't say if it would have been surprising.  The friend I was watching
it with (hi, Judith) guessed the ending correctly ahead of time, so
I expect it probably wasn't.

<p> And if scientists can't invent a convincing artificial strawberry jam
in the next forty years, what good <i>are</i> they?

<p>Oh, wait.  I don't like strawberry jam anyway.
