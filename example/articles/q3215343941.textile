Bagged cliki.org and cclan.org likewise, though still need to point
them at some nameservers with actual records in them.  Current plan is
to host multiple cliki sites on www.cliki.net,
sbcl-internals.cliki.net, diary.cliki.net, etc

<p>The Jargon File now has an entry for "muggle".  I thought I
remembered a time when it actually was a guide to hacker culture and
not just a list of everything Eric Raymond thinks is cool.  Which is
not to say that I didn't enjoy the Harry Potter books - or the film -
but that so did everyone else in the known universe, and should we
expect entries for "chair", "window pane", "tuberculosis" and
"derailleur gear" next because sometimes hackers have some of those as
well.
