<p> Fun with Network Solutions(sic).  Every time I visit their site
(which I try to do as infrequently as possible, I admit) they have
moved it all around again.  These days it appears that despite
there being three independent contacts associated with a zone, 
they will not take updates using the email forms any longer, but
instead want you to use the web-based interface.  For which they give
you only <i>one</i> username/password.  So what are the other two
contacts for then?

<p> Among the things they haven't changed are the length of their
telephone queues.  After fifteen minutes of  being told that my call
would be answered in just a moment, I decided they were lying.  

<p> But at least now I have the right SBCL sources for the trip home.
Hackety hack.
