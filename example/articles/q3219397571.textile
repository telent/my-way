<p> Having in mind my <i>other</i> and previously unstated New Year's
Resolution, my introduction into Drug Culture happened on Saturday
afternoon.  It consisted of two Nurofen (ibuprofen) `tabs', as I
believe the young people call them.

<p>Like, wow, man.  Away with huddling-for-warmth-against-the-radiator, 
I can move around again.

<p> Sunday was <a href="http://www.oxlug.org/">OxLUG</a> day: Martin
Ling on Wireless Networking.
</p>

<p> Today, cold has mostly subsided into cough, lungsful of liquid,
and disinclination to drink vast amounts of beer.  This is a mild
handicap for OxLUG, but it's probably doing me good.

<p> New <a href="http://ww.telent.net/lisp/free-the-x3j-thirteen/2001.12.html"
>ftx13</a>, as you'd expect for the first Monday of the month.
