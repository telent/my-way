<b>cvs.telent.net downtime, imminent.</b>

<p>cvs.telent.net is hosted by my employers.  Due to an office move
this weekend, the network it's attached to is going away.  Indeed, the
box is also going away, but won't immediately be reunited with the
network when it arrives in its new home.  Downtime will be from some
time on Thursday 26th; limited access (essentially just ssh,
cvs-over-ssh, and mail) will be available from mid next week, and full
availability (anon cvs and cvsweb) we're not sure when.  Worst case
estimate is Novemeber, I think, though obviously we're hoping it'll be
considerably sooner.  If it does take a while I may look at enabling
anoncvs over ssh as well.

<p>In short, if you're reliant on anoncvs for any of CLX, araneida,
cliki, or anything else on that machine I'd forgotten about, now would
be a good time to cvs update.

<p>This does not affect www.cliki.net or any of that stuff; that's all
elsewhere.  This is just for access to source code.
