I'm mobile again.  My new laptop battery and PSU arrived yesterday
just as I was leaving for work, so after a complete charge and
discharge last night (more to find out how long it would go for -
about three hours - than out of any real deep-seated belief that the
battery technology demands it), I now have wireless power along with
my wireless networking.  Spent a little too much time last night
wandering around the house saying "yay!  no wires!" when I should
instead have been grovelling over amd64 stack frames.

<p>The stack frame in question (for %MAKE-HASH-TABLE) actually
seems to have little or nothing wrong with it; at least, after I fixed
MOVS to output appropriate REX prefixes (prefices?  prefaces?) where
needed.  Somewhere in the middle of it, though, I'm getting a pointer
to the middle of some vector where I should be getting the boxed float
1.5.  This is probably a fault in floating point (which is directly
lifted from x86) or in the allocator.  I hope it's the allocator.  I
know how that works already.
