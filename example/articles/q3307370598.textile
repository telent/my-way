<p>All's well that ends well.  And while this is not actually over
yet, dabs can now at least tell me that they're intending to 
credit my card "within the next few working days".

<p>Which is, um, only 7 full days after they picked the parcel up, or
three weeks after I received the incorrect order.  Next time I'll be
buying from somewhere that still answers the phone - or at bare
minimum, takes less than 24 hours to reply to email.
