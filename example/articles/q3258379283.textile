<p>I feel like I should be feeling happier about this than I am, but
it's worth noting anyway: SBCL <a href=
"http://sbcl-internals.cliki.net/Threading"> thread support</a> has
landed in CVS HEAD.  It's not enabled by default: you have to
create/edit a customize-target-features.lisp file before building
<pre>
:; cat customize-target-features.lisp
(LAMBDA (LIST) (cons :sb-thread list)) 
</pre>

<p>In the process I broken all the non-x86 ports, but a further commit
fixing the worst of that will be forthcoming as soon as the PPC has
finished building it.

<p>I don't know why it feels like a complete anticlimax though.  Maybe
I need more coffee.

<p> Anyway, feedback (preferably accompanied by bug fixes) to 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=4134"
>sbcl-devel</a> grudgingly accepted.
