Plan c (d? e? I may have lost count, actually) for stream locking in
threaded SBCL.  Let's just have a lock, and keep it in a special
variable, and rebind the special variable when we open a listener on a
logically different device.  Not only is this simpler, but it stands a
reasonable chance of working no matter what kind of stream it was - 
ttyname() doesn't know that <tt>/dev/tty</tt> is <tt>/dev/pts/4</tt>
(for example), so it wasn't really ever going to work in any useful case.
