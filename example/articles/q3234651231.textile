We have working CLiki again!  Well, at least, all the bits I've
checked so far are working again: it's not exactly been tested
exhaustively yet.

<p>I got sidetracked halfway through the afternoon staring at my four
or five new GFs and thinking "hmm, why don't I use
define-method-combination" until I realised that "because it provides
no advantage that I can reasonably easily envisage and I do want to
actually get this <i>finished</i> one day" was in fact the Correct
Answer.

<p>(For the avoidance of doubt, GF in this context stands for Generic
Function.  If I had four or five new girlfriends I'd ... well, for a
start I'd remember whether I had four or five)
