<p> No it doesn't!  No it doesn't!

<p> Assembly routines don't have their own code vectors, so we still
have the callers code vector on entry to gc, so we can calculate the
new lr perfectly easily as an offset from it just like we do for PC
when PC is in fromspace.  <i>Easy</i>

<p>And it was.  But now we blow up building PCL, trying to make a TN
in an infeasibly high-numbered storage class. cvs-commit-and-bed-time
