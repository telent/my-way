Happy Christmas.  Mine was, anyway.

<p>Today I went to the AGM of the SBCL Development Team (UK Chapter).
Or, put another way, I had lunch with <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/Christophe" >Christophe</a>, and we divided
the universe between us.

<p>So we talked about what we were planning and/or hoping to do this
year.  All being well, you can look forward to

<ul>
<li> Native threads
<li> Better CLOS integration.  Faster CLOS too, perhaps.
<li> Generational GC on non-x86 ports
<li> A de-facto standard for contrib software packaging
<li> More ports, possibly: OSX (because it's popular) or HPUX
(because it would help prove the HPPA backend is OK)
<li> "Linkage Tables" port from CMUCL: basically, the ability to dump
a core image with foreign code in it
<li> "State of the Implementation" - an overview paper
<li> XREF port from CMUCL: better introspection in an image ("where is
this defined", "who calls it", etc)
</ul>

<p>Other possibilities - these are less likely to happen without
external contributions ("we're taking patches") or funding.  Or a
miracle might happen, even. 

<ul>
<li> 64 bit port
<li> ARM port
<li> Unicode support
</ul>

<p> Happy New Year ...
