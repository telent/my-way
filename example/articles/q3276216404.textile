One of the things that makes programming easy is Hyperspec lookup from
within emacs.  One thing that makes it a bit nicer yet, on this
underpowered-by-today's-standards laptop, is a lightweight web
browser.  Some people like one of those emacs browsers, but I've never
been able to get used to them, so I use <a
href="http://www.dillo.org/" >dillo</a>.  Here's a kludgey piece of elisp 
to make it use dillo for hyperspec lookup and stick with a "normal"
browser (like Mozilla Firebird) for other links where javascript or
SSL or what-have-you may be needed:

<pre>
(defun browse-url-dillo (url &optional new-window)
  ;; new-window ignored
  "Ask Dillo to load URL.
Default to the URL around or before point.  Always starts a new instance
of Dillo, ignoring new-windonw argument"
  (interactive (browse-url-interactive-arg "Dillo URL: "))
  (start-process (concat "dillo:" url) nil
		 (executable-find "dillo")
		 url))

(defadvice common-lisp-hyperspec (around wrap-dillo 0 (symbol) activate)
  (let ((browse-url-browser-function #'browse-url-dillo))
    ad-do-it))
</pre>
