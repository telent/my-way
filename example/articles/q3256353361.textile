<p>One of the things I am really looking forward to, given a natively
threaded Lisp implementation, is the possibility of writing, acquiring
or just plain waiting for a text editor that can be customized in a
slightly saner language than elisp.  In particular, right now, I would
like a comint mode that either (1) only retains n line sof output, or
(2) (preferably) doesn't eat 30% of my cpu appending lines to the
comint buffer when it gets large.  Where large is around 250k lines,
at the moment.

<p>I hate having to reboot my emacs.
