<p> And another thing ...

<p> While I'm grousing, I should add that I'm still not convinced the
<a href="http://alu.cliki.net/">ALU cliki</a> has developed any kind
of identity independent of <a href="http://www.cliki.net/">CLiki
itself</a>, and I'm really beginning to wonder why I bothered.

<p> Perhaps I should have countered the people who said "CLiki is
restricted to free-software projects, and this is a bad thing; there
should be a more general forum for all kinds of Lisp users" by saying "so
go and make one".  You can't advertise <a
href="http://www.xanalys.com/">Xanalys</a> LispWorks on <a href=
"http://www.franz.com/" >www.franz.com</a>, why should you expect to
be able to advertise Allegro CL on CLiki?

<p> (I should add here that I don't have either of Franz or Xanalys in
mind when I say "these people" - they're just the first two
proprietary Lisp vendors that come to mind)

help students, and to give away stuff.
