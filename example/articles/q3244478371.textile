<p>Favourite recently-bought CD: Supergrass, <i>Life On Other
Planets</i>.  I never really got into their previous stuff, perhaps
because I didn't have the albums, and saturation play of 'Alright' was
never really going to give me a balanced view.  This one reminds me
of the Super Furry Animals - although less Welsh, obviously.

<p>Least favourite recently-bought CD: Gary Moore, <i>Blues and
Ballads</i> (or something.  A greatest hits collection of some kind).
I bought it in Athens airport on the strength of a vague 15-year-old
recollection of "Still Got The Blue" as having blues guitar of some
kind on it, and assumption that Mr Moore was therefore a blues player.
Oops.  It's MOR, and it's derivative MOR with the most painfully
embarrassingly tedious lyrics I have ever seen an artist have the
temerity to print on the sleeve.  Actually, to be strictly honest I've
only managed to listen to a track and a half so far; there's always
the possibility it gets better.

<p>Most recently-bought CD: Rolling Stones, <i>Forty Licks</i>.  There
is something extraordinarily powerful about the intro to `Gimme
Shelter': I don't know how much of it is intrinsic in the music and
how much is the anticipation from having heard it before and
recognising what happens next, but it really does rock.
