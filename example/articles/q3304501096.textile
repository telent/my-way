Anyone know whether a Toshiba Portege 3440CT will work with PC133 RAM?
I just ordered a SO-DIMM of that particular hue as it's half the price
of the PC100 RAM I'm supposed to use in this machine, and web sites
seemed to indicate I had at least a 50% chance of it working ("it's
supposed to, but sometimes it doesn't", seems to be the summary).  I
guess I'll find out when it arrives.
