So, it looks like I have somewhere to live in London.  Which is a
weight off my mind, because I no longer have somewhere to live in
Oxford after next week (and though I might possibly be able to get
away with sleeeping under my desk for a few days, I think people
would get rapidly annoyed if I moved all my books, cds and computers
in here as well)

<P>A couple of people probably had error messages from CLiki last
night complaining about read-only file systems.  This was some kind of
ext3 error, as a result of which I lost my 360 day uptime.  Aw.  Note
that during the course of that year and a bit I did many things to the
system which may not have come up cleanly on boot: while I believe
it's all working and happy again, if you see any behaviours more odd
than usual from it, drop me email.

<p>(CLiki posting was fixed as of about five minutes ago, so don't
email me if you last tried it previous to that)
