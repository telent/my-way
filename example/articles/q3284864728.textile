One more meaningless milestone to share:

I guess I forgot some stuff for the target-features list.  The next
step, after I've been to bed for a few hours, is to rewrite the
assembler glue that I copied from x86 - and probably quite a lot of
the c-call lisp glue which I obtained in similar fashion - for x86-64
calling conventions.  This thing has registers, and it uses quite a
lot of them for passing arguments and return values to/from functions.
