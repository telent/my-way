<p>Another <a href="/slime2.png">SLIME screenshot</a>, with my trademark
gimped arrows to add gratuitous colour.  I don't think it's actually
<i>doing</i> anything that it wasn't last time, but more of it's moved
into sb-introspect now.

<p>Ok, maybe magic spacebar isn't that exciting.  In fact, I turned it
off in ILISP because it's nigh-impossible to recover from if it goes
wrong - which, when it has to access internal functionality, it will
tend to.  That's not a problem any more, right?  The emacs-like
apropos is cute though - and <i>not my work</i>, I must emphasize.
All I'm doing is the SBCL glue.

<P>Right, so let's see what's with the debugger, then.  And add a
slime command to load asdf systems.
