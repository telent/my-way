I'm sitting on a train, going to London.  I don't actually want to go
to London.  I want to go to Didcot - not <i>per se</i>, I add hastily,
but as the first target in a plan that subsequently involves boarding
another train that will take me to Bristol.  I joined this train under
the impression that it also wanted to go to Didcot. Either I got the
train destination wrong, or some other body (Railtrack, Network Rail,
Oxford station managers, Thames Trains, the driver - it's hard to tell
who's responsbile these days) did - but the Railtrack web and wap
sites both agree with me, and the information screens at the station
likewise.  Bum.
