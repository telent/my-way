So you may have seen this elsewhere already, but the <a
href="http://research.microsoft.com/~daniel/unix-haters.html"
>Unix-Haters Handbook</a> is now online.  After reading Donald
Norman's foreword, I went to look for the article he cites:

<blockquote>
Norman, D. A. <i>The Trouble with Unix: The User Interface is Horrid.</i>
Datamation, 27 (12) 1981, November. pp. 139-150. Reprinted in
Pylyshyn, Z. W., & Bannon, L. J., eds. <i>Perspectives on the Computer
Revolution</i>, 2nd revised edition, Hillsdale, NJ, Ablex, 1989.
</blockquote>

eventually finding it it in a shar archive in a message in a <a
href="+http://216.239.53.100/search?q=cache:nBx0rGkRCF8C:ftp.arl.mil/ftp/unix-wizards/V17%2523002">unix-wizards
archive in Google cache</a>.  To make it slightly easier to index in
future, here's a link to the <a
href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~dan/rumor/">unpacked messages</a>.  <a
href="http://www.linux.org.uk/~dan/rumor/rumor.shrink"
>rumor.shrink</a> is the original article, it appears.

<p>Oh, two hundred and something miles later and still alive, yes.  I
didn't mention to the care hire company that I hadn't driven since
passing my test a year ago, it wouldn't have been kind.
