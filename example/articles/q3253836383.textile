Time I was in bed.

<p>Further to yesterday's portable CLX news, here's a <a
href="http://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/lisp/sbcl/" >unportable CLX</a> for
SBCL users.  Will be more use, right now, if you're tracking SBCL in
CVS, but there's a new release due at the end of the month, so it's
not long for the rest of the world to wait.  It includes all the
patches that I posted to the portable CLX list yesterday

<p>After uploading that, I spent a couple of hours fiddling with
Portable Hemlock.  That runs in SBCL now too (patches are on their way
back to Gilbert).
