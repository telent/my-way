After some fairly extensive googling I seem to have fixed the problem
on my laptop that makes the <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2004/3/#30.13645" >clock run too
fast</a>.  Somewhere in 2.5, the Linux people decided to use the TSC
for a time source instead of whatever was previously being used (the
PIT, or the 8042, or something).  My laptop continuously varies CPU
speed to save the battery (and without informing the kernel in any way
that I know about, so the CPU_FREQ stuff is no help), which makes the
TSC go up and down and round and round, or something.  After rebooting
with the option <tt>clock=pit</tt> it seems to be much happier.

<p>Except that <tt>/proc/cpuinfo</tt> now says
<pre>
model name      : Pentium III (Coppermine)
stepping        : 3
cpu MHz         : 0.000
</pre>
which seems ... wrong.  But that's just cosmetic, whereas the clock
drift was causing actual problems.
