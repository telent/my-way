pthreads progress: threads.impure.lisp no more broken than usual.  After <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6723508&forum_id=8256"
>implementing</a> (and then <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=6728621&forum_id=8256" 
>fixing</a> (with thanks to Juho, again)) interrupt-thread, the test
file appears to pretty much work.  Except for the bit where it
assumes thread ids are pids and therefore acceptable to
<tt>sb-unix:unix-kill</tt>, anyway.

<p>Next step: port this forward (which should be trivial), fix it to
not break clone()threads (#ifdef), merge it on HEAD.  Next next step:
even those users who didn't find it icky that we exposed pids to Lisp
as thread ids will be upset by our similar use of the pthreads
thread_t.  So, some kind of object representation of the thread would
be nice.
