<p>I fell asleep in the bath last night; so much of the natural oil
in my skin has leached out that I suspect I'm no longer waterproof.
Memo to self: avoid going out in rain.

<p> At Didcot station they now have an automated system to apologise
for the late running of trains.  It apologised for the late running of
this particular train approximately every three minutes until the
train had stopped at the platform, so some two-bit computer somewhere
is clearly feeling extremely repentant.

<p> They also have payphones with small LCDs displaying "BT PAYPHONE
WELCOME".  Welcome what?  Careful drivers?

<p> 30 minutes of laptop use and it's down to 65% battery remaining,
which is moderately suboptimal.  Turns out to be the fault of pump(8),
which is spinning on the CPU because I took its network card away.
Sigh.  If I wanted to have to run programs before removing PCMCIA
cards, I'd run Windows.
