The new version of trivial-sockets is almost exactly like the previous
one.  In fact the only differences are 
<ul>
<li> in SBCL it now has declares its dependency on sb-bsd-sockets
<li> it's signed using a GPG key that I haven't revoked
<li> and the version number is larger by 0.1
</ul>
I was going to do some more stuff to it: I looked at the patches on <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/trivial-sockets?v=18"
>http://www.cliki.net/trivial-sockets?v=18</a> and found that one of
them involves an API change and the other doesn't work (at least,
ext:accept-tcp-connection doesn't work on udp sockets on <i>my</i>
cmucl installation, and I don't expect it would generally).  So, as
this is all a distraction from what I'm actually supposed to be doing
anyway, I put them aside for another time.

<p>The package will appear on cclan nodes as soon as I remember how to
do that packaging thang.
