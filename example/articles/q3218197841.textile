<p> Twas the day before Christmas &amp;amp;c &amp;amp;c ...

<p> Postgres seems to have improved radically since I last used it.
Back in the 6.x days it had a knack for blowing up, usually at
inconvenient times like Friday nights just as we were about to leave
for the pub.  Today, though, It's tolerably fast, it has manual pages,
and its UncommonSQL bindings actually work out of the box.  Admittedly
UncommonSQL doesn't itself work out of the box with SBCL, but the
necessary patches are fairly obvious and will be going back to
OnshoreD as soon as I'm Back.
