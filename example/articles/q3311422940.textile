The good news is that my leg works again.  I tried it on the FNS last
Friday and then marshalling the rollerstroll on Sunday, and it complained
a bit but didn't actually collapse under me on either occasion, so
although I'm definitely still aware it's there, that's a whole lot
better than having it <i>not</i> be there.  Which is good news and
timely, as I'm taking it to Tignes next week.

<p>And I realise this risks being pretty meaningless stuff to many
readers (supposing for a minute that I have many readers), but I feel
the need to babble about just How Much Fun it is to be wheel-capable
again.  It's probably the nearest we can get to seven-league boots
with current consumer-grade technology.
