Two weird SBCL problems, neither of whicl I have any particularly good
ideas about

<ol>

<li> On Alpha, SBCL versions built with Glibc versions older than
2.3.2 don't run on 2.3.2, complaining about <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/1938"
>invalid args to mprotect</a>.  2.3.2 itself won't build the SBCL
runtime because we use a custom linker script to force stuff under
2Gb, which needs updating for 2.3.2

<li> On X86/threaded, there's some kind of (what I assume to be a)
thread safety bug apparently connected to <tt>&rest</tt> arguments.  I
can't see anything obviously bad in how we create rest lists, but one
iteration in every far-too-many we get messages from
e.g. <b>char-equal</b> saying that <tt>The value 0 is not of type
BASE-CHAR</tt>.  Which is perfectly correct in itself, but as we're
not <i>calling</i> <b>char-equal</b> with 0, seems like it should be
superfuous.

</li>
</ol>
