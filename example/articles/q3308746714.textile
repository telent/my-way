Note for SLIME 1.0 users about indentation: you need cl-indent.

<p>I don't see this anywhere obvious in the manual, but the
much-vaunted (does that mean what I think it means?)  autosensing
macro indentation works <i>in conjunction with</i> cl-indent instead
of replacing it.  In particular it doesn't know how to indent
anything in the COMMON-LISP package.  For a long time I hadn't noticed
this because I have piles of miscellaneous rubbish in my .emacs that
go back years (maybe even decades) and cl-indent happened to be in
there.  When I set up my amd64 box I decided to decruftify a little
and that was one of the casualties. 

<p>To fix: put this in your .emacs or wherever
<pre>
;; (load "cl-indent") ; <b>contrary to my earlier instruction, 
                      ; <tt>require</tt> doesn't work, and
                      ; <tt>load</tt> isn't needed</b>
(setq lisp-indent-function 'common-lisp-indent-function)
</pre>
