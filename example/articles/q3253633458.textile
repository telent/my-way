Something I've been meaning to get around to for a long time: a
"contrib" module system for SBCL.  This is for "code which does not
form part of SBCL itself, but which is sufficiently closely associated
with it that it would not be sensible to run it as a completely
separate project".  Which is to say, code that gets its hands dirty
with SBCL extensions or internals.  So far we have a BSD socket
library, a defsytsem, and (thanks to <a href="http://www.b9.com/"
>Kevin Rosenberg</a>) an ACL-style toplevel, all of which can be
called up using REQUIRE.  More info from <a
					 href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/sbcl/sbcl/contrib/STANDARDS?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup" >contrib/STANDARDS</a> in the SBCL source tree.


<p>Now I'm trying to figure out what the status of CLX is these days.
