Today, in Oxford

<p> <a href="http://web.metacircles.com/">metacircles</a> is now
offering <a href="http://web.metacircles.com/support">per-incident
paid-for support</a> for SBCL and related software.  Presently this
has less to do with actual customer demand and more to do with
<strike>distracting the people who point to lack of commercial support as a
reason not to use free CL</strike> <i>predicted</i> customer demand.

<p> There is a fix in SBCL CVS sb-bsd-sockets for the
writing-to-closed-files bug that SLIME users sometimes experience.

<p> Last week, Frank Neub&uuml;ser found the notes I made last year on
<a href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2002/9/#3.58087">Oracle Wallet
Manager</a>.  By spooky co-incidence, I had occasion on Monday to
revisit this experience and revise my notes in that light: you can now
find the new version (and Frank's email) <a
href="http://web.metacircles.com/oracle%20wallet%20manager" >over at
metacircles</a>
