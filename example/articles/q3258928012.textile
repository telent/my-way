<p>The ads that Sourceforge insert in the footers of messages from the
email lists they host are usually both amusing and saddening, and the
reason is the same in both cases: their complete inapplicability.  In

problems that dynamic languages don't even have anyway.  "Debugging
C/C++ programs can leave you feeling lost and disoriented".  So Don't
Do That Then ...
