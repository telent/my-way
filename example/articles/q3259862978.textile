After testing SBCL/threaded on a real SMP system, I quite rapidly
(well, rapidly <i>after</i> adding appropriate debugging cruft to stop
all the threads as soon as any of them fails an assertion) found
several places it really could have used locks and didn't have.  So
now it has, and I'm looking for weirdness in the decide-when-to-gc
code.  More precisely, I'm typing this while watching it rebuild after
having removed a lot of cruft in the decide-when-to-rebuild code.  If
it's still broken after doing this, at least it'll be more obvious how.

<p>I think we're probably going to do a 0.pre8 release at or around
the end of the month so that a slightly wider audience can bang on it.
