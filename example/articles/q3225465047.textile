        Merge PPC port
        ... new directories src/compiler/ppc, src/assembly/ppc
        ... other new files
        ... new clause in genesis for PPC fixups
        ... new files in runtime, PPC conditionals added in other .[ch] files

        Small Makefile cleanups in runtime
        ... actually _use_ the dependency information
        ... regenerate depends on source changes

        We don't actually use sigreturn() in _any_ present port: conditionals
        changed to make this obvious

<p> You read it here third.
