Mailing lists continued to not work for a couple of days, until I
noticed and restarted cron.  <I>Now</i> I think it's all working
again. 

<p>I have little time for hacking this weekend because in observance
of my New Years Resolution of <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2002/1/#7.47171" >2002</a> I must
spend the next few days abusing solvents.  That's right, I need to
clean the house.

<p>The spray-on shower cleaner comes with instructions that say "for
best results, use on a clean shower".  Can't help wondering why I
bothered buying that, then.
