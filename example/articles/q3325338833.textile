I must start diary entries with shorter sentences.  That or do
something <i>sensible</i> with my rss generator such that Planet Lisp
doesn't get really ugly titles, but that would involve hacking and we
all know I don't do that any more

<p>The Awesome Power of Open Source came through for me in the end: I
eventually found an app called <a href="http://moto4lin.sf.net"
>moto4lin</a> on Sourceforge which - after some smacking with the
gdbhammer, as the error messages are not really conducive to working
out what on earth it's trying to do - lets me <a
href="http://moto4lin.sf.net">download pictures and other files on my
v220 in Linux</a>.

<pre>
void P2kProc::drv_switchP2K(char * st)
{
        char cmd[1024];
        sprintf(cmd,"echo \"AT+MODE=8\" > %s", (st == 0) ? ACMdev : st);
        system(cmd);
}
</pre>

I'm pretty sure that even C++ has enough library support that you
could do this without recourse to the shell, but leaving aside the
slightly questionable style, <tt>AT+MODE=8</tt> has a truly magical
effect on a v220 - it causes it to stop being a tty, change its USB
product id, and start presenting some probably-motorola-proprietary
"P2K" interface to USB, which the moto4lin program will understand.
Then I can browse the filesystem and also do SEEM editing, which
latter sounds potentially irreversible so I have decided not to bother
with until I have some idea what on earth it is.

<p>How to get it <i>out</i> of this P2K mode again, other than by
disconnecting the USB cable, I don't yet know.  There's no longer any
tty to which I can issue <tt>AT+MODE=0</tt>

<p>The picture quality is exactly as bad as I was expecting, by the
way.  Still, nice gimmick.
