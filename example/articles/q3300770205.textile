title: Forget what I said about inline alloc

Forget what I said about inline alloc.  On unthreaded builds, or on a
P4, it makes things <i>slower</i>, and we don't yet know why.  Inline
allocation has been disabled for the moment until someone (preferably
with a better grasp of assembly-level optimization than me) looks at
it.

<p>My keyboard skills are even worse than usual, lately.  After
noticing twinges in my left wrist when chording sequences like C-t or
C-w (which, yes, I do entirely left handed, naughty me, in my defence
I can say only that my laptop has no control key on the right) I
remapped the Caps lock key as Control and turned the Control key into
Super.  Well, that was the intention: in practice it seems a bit
trickier, at least 
<a href="http://www.tjic.com/computers/x11_emacs_modifier_keys.php"
>as far as GNU Emacs is concerned</a>.  But I will probably have a
working Super key again just as soon as I restart X, so I guess that's
one silver lining to keep in mind next time the computer crashes.
Anyway, point being: I'd forgotten how many control sequences (C-a,
C-e, C-k, C-t) are pretty much muscle memory in my everyday typing,
and now they don't work any more.  Slowly getting used to it.
