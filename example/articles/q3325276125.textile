For the record, the <a

>afore-mentioned</a> <a
href="http://www.bvrp.com/customers/motorola/v3/buy/" >Windows
software</a> - which I gave in and bought, in the hope of getting it
to work in Wine - is approximately as usable as xmms (for
approximately the same reasons, too), and also doesn't seem to do
anything anyway even in real Windows.  More on this some other time,
but in the meantime it only goes to confirm my previous opinion that
mobile phone hardware companies are much more interested in network
operators than network users, and any network user who cares
significantly about being able to do what <i>they</i> want with their
personal electronic equipment - rather than what some marketer
somewhere thinks they should want - should look to some platform other
than the mobile phone (say, a PDA) for doing it.
