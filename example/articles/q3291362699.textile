OK, No more PHP whinging.  After three days of reading PHP references
followed by a relaxing(sic) weekend spent staring at x86-64 assembly,
I'm starting to see why it is the way it is; at some future date I
will regale you all with my opinions, but in the meantime I'm still
thinking.

<P>(Which is not to say that I think it's that way for <i>good</i>
reasons, just that I don't have quite thw same expectations as I
started out with)
