<p> You're all wondering how it went, I know.  I compromised.  Current
thinking: it's still sometimes convenient to pass rows around from one
function to another, and this might just as well be in an object of
some kind as a property list or similar ad hoc structure - because
then we don't have to rewrite all those silly methods to format it
into silly functions to format it.  I am still convinced, however,
that trying to do anything with the identity of these objects, or
keeping them for any length of time, is Wrong.  All <i>trace</i> of
object caching is gone.

<p> In the process I've spent a fair amount of time staring at bits of
SQL and running queries through the analyser; changing types here,
adding indices there, etc etc.  (Why is my creditcard issue number a
bignum?  I find it hard to imagine that'd get often get much byond 9,
never mind <tt>(ash 1 31)</tt>).  So, the overall impact is good.
