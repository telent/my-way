More Emacs magic.  The documentation for PSGML is a bit iffy in
places, but it does profess to cope with split documents, and I've
managed to imbue it with at least enough smarts to close tags when I
press C-c /, and to not beep at the end of each line.  Which is
refreshing

<pre>
(define-key global-map [f11] 
  '(lambda () (interactive nil)
    (let ((s (shell-command-to-string "echo `date +%s` + 2208988800 | bc ")))
      (find-file (format "~/doc/telent/htdocs/diary/data/%s.html"
			 (subseq s 0 (1- (length s)))))
      (setf sgml-parent-document '("HEADER.inc" "HTML" "BODY" "BODY" ())))))
</pre>

<p> If you're curious, the magic constant in the bc calculation is the
number of seconds between 1900 and 1970

<p> Reclaimed my cellphone from the phone repair people.  This time
they've mamaged to repair it (they "reflowed the pa's and filters",
whatever that involved) without deleting all the numbers, which is
nice as I forgot to back it up before taking it in.
