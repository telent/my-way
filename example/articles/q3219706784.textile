<p> This is more of a placeholder than a diary entry.  

<p> New new db-sockets released after Christophe pointed out that 0.5
&lt; 0.44, so expect to get 0.52.  Comes with free update to the
documentation generator, which looks marginally prettier

<p> Spent too long hunting necessary bits of paper to do tax return.
It seems to all make sense now, though.

<p> Not the best driving lesson in the world.  If I could just
concentrate for 40 minutes, I could pass the test.  Need to work on
that, I fear.

<p> Back to SBCL/PPC
