Marilyn Manson's cover of "Personal Jesus" is such a missed
opportunity.  It sounds just like the original with guitars.
Johnny Cash should have done it instead.

<p>OK, I've said that before

<p>(Yes, I know it's no longer possible for Cash to sing anything else
he hasn't sung already.  You needn't email me just to point that out)

<p><b>Edit: </b> OK, it turns out he <i>has</i> covered it.  Many
thanks to all the people who've corrected my appalling lack of
knowledge.  You can stop now ...
