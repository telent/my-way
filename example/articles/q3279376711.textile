<P>Interview went not so well: feedback was that I was "wary of perl",
which is somewhat embarrassing given that it's one of my three
favourite programming languages.  Need to work on that a little,
perhaps.  Hmm.

<p>Added another LU&amp;D <a href="http://web.metacircles.com/cliki_here"
>article</a> pointer to the metacircles site: this one was about
CLiki.  It's giving me ideas for an article on setting up SBCL to do
web development with Araneida:  "0 to (port) 80 in 3000 words".

<p>Though, conceded, probably port 8000 if you're sensible.  I
would tend to avoid running SBCL as root.
