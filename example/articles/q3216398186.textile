<p> Some anonymous contributor linked to the preview release of FTX13
from the relevant CLiki page.  The only reason I hadn't was that I
forgot to, so I think that's reasonable.  Wish they'd left their name,
though.

<p> BSM (whose web site I will not link to, because it's useless) tell
me that I'm going to have to pay for tomorrow's driving lesson even
though I attempted to ring on Saturday to cancel it (there was nobody
there).  Not entirely happy about that.

<p> Still using emacs 21.  Still haven't got as far as trying ilisp
with it yet.
