<p> Still alive.  Not entirely sure how much difference that makes.

<p> I took the weekend off.  Due to a combination of friends round on
Saturday night, Dune on Sunday night, and finding all the Philip
Pullman books were on special offer in Borders on Friday evening, 
I got no computer time all weekend other than a swift email check.
On the other hand, I hoovered the carpets downstairs, which must be
worth something.

<p> Having just finished getting a bunch of work done (as referred to
in previous entry), it might be time to look at some of that lisp
stuff again.  I've somehow managed to page my free projects TODO list
out of main memory, though, and can't remember what I had lined up.
So, we'll see if anyone complains.
