Two out of three leaves ample room for improvement.  My order from
Dabs arrived today; 512MB RAM as ordered, Asus K8V-SE mobo ditto, and
an Athlon XP with a sticker which incorrectly claimed it was an Athlon
64.  Bunch of muppets.

<p>For the people who know as much about current PC hardware as I did
last week, know that the Athlon XP and Athlon 64 are entirely
different beasts in most practical respects.  They run different code,
fit different motherboards and are different physical shapes.  They
also, for what it's worth, come in different packaging: the clearly
visible printing on the box that said "Athlon XP" was my first clue
that something was not supplied As Described.
