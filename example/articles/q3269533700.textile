<p>One of my ambitions w.r.t Lisp packaging is to make the ancient
<a href="/lisp/howto.html">CMU Common Lisp on Linux</a> document
obsolete.

<p>OK, so I could achieve that (and in fact, have) just by leaving it
three years without an update, so perhaps I should restate that goal
more clearly: I want to make this document (and others like it)
<i>unnecessary</i>.

<p>Anyway, another step further down that road today, with the release
of <a href="http://www.cliki.net/asdf-install">asdf-install</a> into
an unsuspecting SBCL CVS tree.  Now we can download and install CCLAN
modules from the command line (or from inside a running Lisp)
