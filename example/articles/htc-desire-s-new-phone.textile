subject: HTC Desire S, unlocked, new, £359

No, I'm not selling it at that price.  I just bought it at that price.
Amazon and Handtec are both advertising it at about £371 and other
well-known online retailer (expansys, etc) at even more: what I did
was notice that the O2 Store sell it for £349 plus £10 topup, and that
Carphone Warehouse have recently introduced a Network Price Promise so
even though their advertised price for the same phone and tariff is
£399 they will give it to you for the £359 price if you insist.  And
because it's CPW and not a tied shop, they will (well, most probably
will, and certainly did in my case) give you the unlocked and
unbranded handset.  In fairness I should say I don't know whether the
handset in the O2 store would have been locked or not.

I've only had a few minutes to play with the phone so far so haven't
formed a strong opinion (HTC Sense may have to go ...) on it yet, but
it's already very clearly an upgrade from my really rather elderly
