MORE CONSUMERISM.  

<p>The headphones work a lot better with the large earbuds instead of the
default medium-sized ones, though still require some fiddling to get
them placed so that the sound isn't muffled and isn't tinny either.
They do reduce external noise significantly too, but they're a long
way from letting me walk around in blissful silence: I can still hear
traffic and stuff.  Which I think is probably good.

<p>I can find no way of getting pictures off my phone over the USB
cable, without forking out for a piece of Windows software (which I'd
then have to run under Wine or something).  I thought I read something
that indicated it would do OBEX over the USB connection if fed the
appropriate AT commands to put it into obex mode, but despite
extensive searching I can't find that page any more so I might have
imagined it.  Gah.
