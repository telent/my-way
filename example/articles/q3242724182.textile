<li>The other week I talked to an Oracle support guy on the phone.  He
was smart.  We agreed that the configuration we're using is
unsupported by Oracle (third-party Apache modules in their web
server), but that it probably should work anyway, and he gave us a
reasonable workaround.  Then we spent a few minutes talking about the
suboptimality involved in trying to force-fit a strictly hierarchical
model of the world onto a real world which is not even vaguely
hierarchical, which is a subject on which I have fairly strong
opinions.

<li>Today I get this error message.
<blockquote>
An error was encountered while loading page. Failed to initialize
configuration parameter ApacheMainServer.. Error in the input config
file. Attribute KeepAlive is a single value attribute.
</blockquote>

</li>
</ul>

How can the same company have smart tech support people like that and
apparently moronic programmers?  <i>Which</i> input config file?
There are only about eight of the things - and in all cases where the
word <tt>KeepAlive</tt> is used in any of them, it is indeed followed
by a single value.
