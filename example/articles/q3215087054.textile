<p> I realise there's an ambiguity in the last-but-one entry.
Yesterday I started to clean the house.  I did not however start to 
clean the visitors.  OK.

<p> Threads lead to queues and queues lead to locking, and before we
know where we are, we have the alpha asm reference open again to look
at how LDQ_L and STQ_C work.  Cool.
