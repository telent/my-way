For the record, I was wrong.  We don't find catch tags by searching
the stack; we maintain a linked list starting at *CURRENT-CATCH-TAG*.
This is good news insofar as searching the stack is not a precise
science and it might not have been possible to fix things if we had
been chaining through stack frames.  This is bad news in that I can't
find what's clobbering the aforesaid *CURRENT-CATCH-TAG*, so although
I have no doubt it's possible to fix things, I presently don't know
how.  In other words, don't expect a fix for 0.8.14

<p>In other news: 
<ol>
<li> I'm playing with Eclipse again: rationalisation for this is that
something strange happened to sawfish on my last apt-get upgrade, so I
think I'd like a window manager that Debian doesn't know how to break.

<li> More episodes involving minor skin loss; arm still aches a bit
but seems to be getting better; no visible bruising.  Bought new
skates a week or so ago; left them at home this morning (it was
raining) and only realised how much improved the fit is when I went
out at lunch in the old ones to get a sandwich.

<li> I am 30.  It doesn't seem to be much different.

</ol>
