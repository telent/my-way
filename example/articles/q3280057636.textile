<p>Editing on both CLiki and the ALU Wiki is <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/CLiki_News">temporarily disabled</a>.
There's not a lot to say about the combination of intelligence and
social skills that must be involved in defacing a world-writable web
site, so I'll let it rest.

<p>Not a lot of free stuff hacking lately.  I've been working on
Stargreen and <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.web/292"
>thinking about testing</a>.  Which developed into thinking about
completely redesigning the underneath of Araneida to separate
<b>request</b> and <b>response</b> so that it could sensibly support
an HTTP client as well as a server.   Which stopped developing when I
realised that most of it is presently, right now, YAGNI.  

<p>Then yesterday was divided more or less equally between travelling
to Manchester and travelling back from Manchester; the intervening
period spent doing a written Perl test (and swearing at MS Word, which
is not my idea of the world's best Perl editor, really).  Manchester
quite nice but not a lot of free time to explore - spent most of it in
Waterstones reading about truss rods.
