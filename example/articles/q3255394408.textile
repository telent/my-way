This lame excuse for a web crawler is <i>editing cliki pages</i>.
Automatically.  Specifically, it's stripping out carriage returns from
the body, which as you can imagine makes it difficult to see where the
paragraph breaks are.

<p>I don't know if the fault here is with <a
href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~rcm/websphinx/" >WebSPHINX itself</a>
or someone's custom crawler based on it, but if people are going to
write software that doesn't actually work, they should not let it out
on the internet.  Really.

<p>Oh, and I might also point out that the pages in question contain
<pre>
&lt;meta NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="noindex,nofollow">&lt;/meta>
</pre>

in the head element, so robots really have no business being there
anyway.
