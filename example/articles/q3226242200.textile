<p> I think when this month ends it may be time to start a new page
and confuse google again.

<P> SBCL MP proceeds.  No more random memory corruption (it wasn't all
that random anyway, to be honest, it just looked random), thread
switch primitives adapted from the previous foray (in other words,
they ought to work but bitrot may have done nasty things), a trivially
simple scheduler which amounts to "run the next process which was
blocked on a read() or write() call" (we actually use non-blocking IO
and a poll() loop, so <i>would have blocked</i> is more accurate) "or
if none, the next process in the <tt>*ready-process*</tt> list", and
the necessary hackery in fd-streams to make processes go to sleep when
they block instead of hooking up to the serve-event mechanism to do
output later.  It's going to be easier to rip out serve-event and
reimplement it using threads than it is to make threads coexist nicely
with the present serve-event.

<p><i>Testing</i> it is yet to happen.  Um, yeah...  When it again
reaches the point of completely compiling, I can carry on hacking it
using <tt>chill</tt> and redefining things in the running lisp.
