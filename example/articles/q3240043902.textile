<p>
I've not been writing much lately, because I haven't had much (a) to
write about, (b) time to write it in.  More (b) than (a), in fact.

<p>Oracle error messages, <i>n</i> in a series of
<tt>most-positive-fixnum</tt>:
<pre>
:; owm      
Exiting
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at oracle.ewt.lwAWT.BufferedApplet.&lt;init>(Compiled Code)
        at oracle.sysman.emSDK.client.appContainer.WebApplication.&lt;init>(Compiled Code)
        at oracle.security.admin.wltmgr.owma.OwmaApp.&lt;init>(Compiled Code)
        at oracle.sysman.emSDK.client.appContainer.WebApplication.main(Compiled Code)
Done.
</pre>

<p>The error message actually means "cannot connect to X server".
Isn't it <i>obvious</i>?  It also means "we don't accept any of the
standard toolkit options", of course.  

<p>It turns out that we actually want to be using the Oracle
Enterprise Login Assistant for this instead anyway.  It has basically
the same deficiency but doesn't insist on displaying a splash screen,
so can actually map its window and get on with answering requests
without user input.
