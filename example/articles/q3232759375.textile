Welcome to the brand new diary system.  With luck you should barely
notice the difference, but I do.  One-file-per-entry, lashings of Common
Lisp, and small amounts of emacs glue.  The only real gap (so far) is
a way of telling emacs that these files are fragments of HTML BODY
content so I can use psgml for element competion and suchlike.
