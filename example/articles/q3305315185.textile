I should have written about "Fast User-extensible Streams" before.
This is currently all just handwaving, and its intended goal is as a
stream substrate for SBCL (replacing fd-streams) rather than to become
a standard.  There's an <a
href="http://sbcl-internals.cliki.net/fu-stream" >sbcl-internals cliki
page</a> where you can find a pointer to wherever the latest draft is
living, and comment on it.

<p>To save myself the trouble of writing a third entry - and you the
trouble of reading it - I may as well add here that my leg though not
actually <i>right</i> again is sufficiently better that I can walk at
normal speeds with only a slight ache, and descend stairs in merely
moderate discomfort.  I have a newfound admiration for anyone who
loses the use of one or more legs more seriously than I did, and add
that unless you've had an injury of that kind and know this
experience, you have <i>no idea</i> how much enjoyment I'm getting from
the pursuit of such simple pleasures as being able to walk around
again without being overtaken by grannies all the time.
Crippled-no-more.
