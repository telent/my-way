The darcs side called.  It left a message.  The message is 
<ul>
<li> <a
href="http://verisons.telent.net/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi">http://verisons.telent.net/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi</a>
- pointyclicky stuff
<li> darcs get http://verisons.telent.net/<i>repository</i>
</ul>

Note that (1) for reasons I don't feel much like figuring out at this
time of night, at time of writing my secondary dns doesn't seem to
believe verisons.telent.net exists, (2) I am not aware of any way
except through the cgi that you can find out what repositories exist
yet - as I write this, the answer is "clx", but tomorrow I'll add
cliki-related projects and the rest.

<p>First impression, btw, is that the cgi thing is probably not going
to be available for long, as xsltproc eats machine resources like,
well, like something designed by XML users.
