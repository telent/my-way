Do POSIX subcommittees ever look at each others' work?  The
implementation of <b>interrupt-thread</b> is made more complicated by
it not being possible to <a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/sigqueue.html"
><tt>sigqueue</tt></a> a thread, and likewise not being possible to <a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_kill.html"
><tt>pthread_kill</tt></a> and pass any data to the thread being
signalled.  So, we need something held per-thread to indicate what
code to interrupt it with, and then some stupid locking regime so that it
can be interrupted from two other threads at once without something
weird happening.  OK, it's not rocket science, and scalability
arguments probably don't matter too much as we don't really expect
interrupt-thread to be used in expected-to-be-fast code anyway.  It's
still annoying, though.

<p>I still haven't bought a new laptop; I'm still trying to figure out
whether I actually need one or not: so far, the only requirement I've
identified is to be able to IRC in front of the TV from time to time,
and that's not pressing really.  I did also wonder for a while whether
I could use a PDA, but after thinking a while longer, maybe I can get
away with a <a href="/dates.html">text file</a> instead.
