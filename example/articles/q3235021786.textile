<p><b>glibc 2.3</b>: the existing C library locale model is inadequate
for threaded applications.  I can believe this but I'm not sure I see
why the POSIX locale model is worth caring about anyway.  The current
thread-local storage API is ugly, so 2.3 introduces a new
<tt>_thread</tt> keyword to C, which has the same approximate syntax
as <tt>register</tt> or <tt>static</tt>.  And people are using
internal symbols (<tt>__setfpucw</tt>, anyone?) and geting broken by
it on glibc upgrades, so from now on all the internal symbols are
marked with the version <tt>GLIBC_PRIVATE</tt>.
