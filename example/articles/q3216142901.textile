<p> So yesterday was accounts day two; all that remains now is to drop
the invoices in the post, and everything else can go to the
<i>real</i> accountants up in London.

<p> Back to train-to-Sunbury goodness today, to be followed by more of
the same next week.  In the meantime, some significant portion of
weekend is probably going to be <a href="/cliki/Free_the_x3j_thirteen"
>FTX13</a> time, and maybe setting up cliki.{org,net}.  First, though,
I need to get some food and finish the bottle of wine I started
yesterday while it's still drinkable.
