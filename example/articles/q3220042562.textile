title: A whole day of rebuilding bits of SBCL PPC with not much clear

<p> A whole day of rebuilding bits of SBCL PPC with not much clear
idea of what's going wrong, except that it's probably something to do
with the combination of MAP, anonymous lambdas, and APPLY.  It all 
works fine until I want the closure to modify the state it's closed
over, but that seems to affect the way in which the closure is
compiled (which is fair enough), causing it to not work at all (which isn't).

<p> Later: well, in some cases it works fine even when one tries to mutate
the closed-over state.

<p> Rats.
