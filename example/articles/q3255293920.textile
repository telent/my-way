For the record, I should add that in the following (chronologically
preceding) entry, I was not making fun of "bziki__"'s typing.  (My
typing is, I freely admit, too bad for me to be able to do that to
anyone else).  I was making fun of the <i>content</i>.

<p>SBCL 0.7.13 is out (or at least, tagged.  Not sure if it's been
announced outside of sbcl-devel yet).  SBCL 0.7.13.{1-3,5} contain
various fixes and refactorings made during the course of thread
development, and now it's time to fork another thread branch from
0.7.13.5 and carry on.
