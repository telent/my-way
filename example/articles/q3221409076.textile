<p> Later ...

<p> On Saturday, <a href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mbit"
>Simon</a> (who would get a link to his <i>real</i> homepage, only it
appears to have turned into something else) turned up, so time for the
impromptu tour of Oxford's Historic Buildings.

<p>Well, some of them.  We only had the afternoon available, so I
picked an unrepresentative subset plus the Norrington Room at Blackwells.
And it rained, which is not unusual for the area at this time of year.

<p>A lot of the time since then has been spent hitting (and where
possible, fixing) small bugs in SBCL PPC.  Flaoting point traps and
endianness; suddenly I know more about IEEE 754 than I (a) ever felt the
need to, or (b) did after a month studying numerical analysis at
university.  Which is, actually, still not much.  Kahan looks like an
amazingly cool guy, though.

<p>In between that I've been looking for file descriptor leaks in
Araneida.  I can't find any way to trigger them on demand, and I can't
find out what causes them, and they're still happening.  Bah.  I
thought common lisp was supposed to be good for robust systems?
