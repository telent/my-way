<p>In the last <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/dan/diary.html?start=43" >three
and a bit years</a> of self-employment, I have learned that I am a
better software developer than I am a salesperson, and that the
opportunities for contract SBCL development are too few and far
between to make a living out of anyway.  There are those who would
argue that I should have known both of those things three years ago,
but, well, I feel better to have found out for certain.  And the
(fairly interesting, but not quite my vocation) unix/web/database/etc
work I've been doing in the meantime has funded some quite neat unpaid
SBCL work anyway.

<p>But, as I said, my motivation for sales is matched only by my aptitude
at same, and as I don't right now have people queueing up outsde the
door to thrust work into my laid-back, casual, and ungrateful hands, I
think it's time to draw a line under that life episode and start
looking for something else to do.  In other words, I've been kind of
busy with agencies and similar stuff in the last few days.  Will Hack
For - well, sensible amounts of money, as the saying nearly goes.
