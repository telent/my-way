<p>Quick note:  the futex problem is not actually futex-related.  Linux
2.6 behaves differently to 2.4 in what it does when <tt>int 3</tt>
happens while a SIGTRAP is masked.

<p>Quick note 2: Araneida 0.81 (bug fixes only) to start happening
tonight when I get back from dinner.  I need a better test suite for
that thing.
