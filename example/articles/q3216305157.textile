<p> FTX13 November issue is due out tomorrow.  You can see the
preview now at <a

http://ww.telent.net/lisp/free-the-x3j-thirteen/2001.11.html</a> (not
at all an easily guessable URL, no).  To be honest, it's looking a bit
short if anything.  I'm sure something else must have happened this
month...
