Just back from listening to <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil
Gaiman</a> read at Borders.  The event listing on his web site didn't
mention signing, so I foolishly assumed there would be none; when I left
the event there was a queue of better-prepared people halfway across
the floor.  

<p>Fun, though.  He read "Wolves in the Walls", then answered
questions.

Where do I get my ideas from?</a>  Confluence.  You should be
very careful asking that question, because 90% of authors will make up
a joke answer".  Favourite characters: Delirium (Sandman), Crowley -
or possibly Death (Good Omens), Wednesday (American Gods).  No, there
probably won't be another Pratchett collaboration.  His <a
href="http://www.greenmanreview.com/day_of_the_dead.html">Babylon 5</a>
episode was pretty much entirely his own work.  And his <a

>sinister beard</a> makes him look, well, sinister.  But also kind of
cool (as if he didn't already).
