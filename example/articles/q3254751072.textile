Pet peeve right now: packages (or distribution packaging policies,
where applicable) that don't include the documentation.  This is the
kind of thing you only really find the need for when away from the Net
(like now, on a coach).  Surely Debian could include a
"documentation-package-for" as one of its package dependency types,
then I could put something in my apt configuration to say "always grab
the docs as well".  I can see some kind of (steadily weakening)
argument for not making it the default, but for most people it's not
as if disk is a scarce commodity any longer.

<p>Oh well.  I spent rather a long time already today on recompiling
CLX - think my battery is about to go flat anyway.  Now that still
<i>is</i> a scarce commodity.
