<p> So I started out by looking at <a href="http://www.fftw.org/"
>FFTW</a>, but (a) calling C is enough of a mess that I prefer not to,
(b) it wants doubles as input, not the shorts that I actually have,
(c) I wanted to find out how an FFT works anyway.  Lots of web
trawling later I game up on most of the other FFT code snippets I
could find, downloaded the appropriate <a
href="http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/bookcpdf.html"
>Numerical Recipes</a> ("In C" variant) chapter, and transcribed their
C into Lisp.  With a few type declarations it does a
forward-then-reverse in-place transform in about 1.4ms.

<p> Then I actually <i>did</i> try FFTW, and it's slower (2.2 seconds
for the forward transforms alone).  Could be C calling overhead, or my
lousy measurements, or possibly that 2^10 is neither a very big nor
complicated size anyway and I would have found it more of a win if I
had some weirdo 31765 byte buffer, or something.

<p> And earlier today I saw <a

Trouble was, having re-read a lot of Jon Courtenay Grimwood books
recently (he throws neuroscience terms around like confetti - or like
confetti would be if it were heavier, slightly squishy,
oxygen-dependent, full of chemicals and - and actually not very much
like confetti at all, then) is that I kept hearing Princess Amidala's
name as <a
