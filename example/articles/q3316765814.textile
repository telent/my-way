MORE PTHREADS.  sbcl-devel subscribers will already have seen the
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/4256"
>current state</a> - it appears to work superficially but there are
still holes.  Most obviously right now, there's some evil recursive
bustup in internal-error support, so any attempt to run an undefined
function will cause SBCL to come to a short and sticky end.

<p>The previous `4 is not a list' was caused by a literal 4 that
should have been an 8 - or probably even an <tt>n-word-bytes</tt>, and
then we found that assembly trampolines must be 8 byte aligned so that
their addresses look like fixnums to the GC.
