I have some kind of phone interview thing tomorrow morning, so I
really should be asleep right now.  But

<ul>
<li> Small SLIME hackage so that the SBCL backend also works with
Helmut's new code for choosing from a list when multiple definitions
of a function are found.  Right now this works for generic functions:
M-. one of them and you get a list of all the methods

<li> Better support for conditional GET in Araneida.  Now when you
call <b>request-send-headers</b> it returns the HTTP response code it
sent, and when you call it with a sensible <tt>:last-modified</tt>
argument and <tt>:conditional t</tt>, it may turn your 200 response
into a 304.  In which case, you get to go home early without having to
do that tedious  database query.

<li> Using which, I managed to straighten out the conditional GET in
<a href="http://www.stargreen.com/">Stargreen</a> a little.  Stargreen
is an Araneida application but a very old one in parts - possibly
dating right back to the time before Araneida was so named - and it
uses bits of the system that I've forgotten exist and I strongly
suspect nobody else has ever dared try.
