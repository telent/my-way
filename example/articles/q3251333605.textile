--text follows this line--

* CLiki is the collaborative community content creation system that
  most people here have probably heard of already.

* Araneida is the web server it runs on

* db-sockets is the socket library that Araneida uses

SBCL and CMUCL (the latter untested recently) are the implementations
this all runs on

New versions of the asterisked items are all (at last) now
available from cCLan, or will be as soon as the mirrors propagate.
See http://ww.telent.net/cclan-choose-mirror for your nearest.

These are labelled `betaish' because, although the basic code they
contain has been running on the real CLiki site for some time, there
may be packaging, portability and other issues that prevent them from
actually working out of the box.  Any bugs you do find are either
known or probably trivial, though.  Feedback sought.

Happy New Year, if you mark the occasion at or around this time.  I
wish you a happy next 12 months anyway, even if you don't.
