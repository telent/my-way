I swapped a few of the links in this page's header around.  No major

so this has been a busy week.  It's also been a pretty stunning week
weather-wise, so I've been attempting to make the most of that by
getting outside: now I have a skin deficit on both elbows, my knees
creak alarmingly until I've warmed them up by skating a couple of
miles, and my leg hurts.  Oh, yeah, and my shoulder is better but
still not actually well.  Truly I am on peak form for <a
