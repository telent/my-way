<p> I think I actually spent most of the weekend, and of Monday, in
bed.  There was no really good reason for this; I just didn't feel
that I wanted to get up.  By Monday night I'd changed my mind and got
up, and it was Tuesday evening before I next slept.  So, I woke up
today at 5am, which means I get to see daylight today.  Definite
improvement.

<p> More SBCL raw address fun: I checked what CMUCL did, and on PPC it
does in fact store the Function address in the Fdefn raw-address slot 
- so requires none of the alterations to jump instruction sequences
we've been having to do.  So we could potentially even revert them.
This also fixes the make-random-state bug that I'd previously kludged
my way past.

<p>Current issues:

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1663/0/7348688/"
>def!struct/csubtypep</a>
<li> After printing <tt>/about to SETF GETHASH SB-NAMES in
DEFINE-STORAGE-BASE</tt> it jumps to some random address that doesn't
appear in the map file, which contains a relative jump instruction
with offset 0 - infinite loop
</li>
</ul>
