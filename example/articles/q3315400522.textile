loaclhost.telent.net (a.k.a cvs.telent.net) boots!  I spent entirely
too long farting around with the sata_via module before realising that
Jeff Garzik had already <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/111222/"
>added support</a> for the VT6421 back in November (and it still
hasn't been merged into the kernel, at least as of 2.6.10-ac10), but
now it seems to be pretty much all there.  You can't get to it yet as
it's on the wrong side of my DSL, but as soon as it returns to the net
(next week, I hope) we should be resuming service.  If you formerly
had an ssh login for it, you still have (I've copied home directories
across) and needn't resend anything, but please note that the host key
will have changed - the new fingerprint is <tt>
6a:2a:97:cf:d5:1b:da:74:14:d2:21:d8:d9:d3:48:b7</tt>.

<p>There are probably a ton of packages that used to be on it that I
haven't yet reinstalled, but lots of those were only there due to the
machine's former career as a desktop box.  If you find anything
missing, drop me a note.

sda is on the Adaptec 2940 that's still installed to boot from (SRM
doesn't recognise the SATA controller).  Unbelievable though it may be
to anyone who's never used an Alpha SX164, anything attached to the
motherboard IDE interface was actually <i>slower</i> than that scsi
drive.
