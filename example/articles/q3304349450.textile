<p>Extending (or, mostly, just implementing) CL streams.  Motivations:
(a) Araneida's serve-event model doesn't work in a threaded SBCL with
threaded SLIME attached (workaround is to <tt>(setf
swank:*communication-style* :fd-handler)</tt> in
<tt>.swank.lisp</tt>); (b) people doing Unicode in SBCL are also
having interesting experiences with fd-streams; (c) the 
<a href="http://common-lisp.net/pipermail/streams-standard-discuss/"
>streams-standard-discuss/</a> list has been empty since it was set up.

<p>In other news, very very cheesed off.  In a fit of transient
stupidity I stacked on the LondonStake last night and managed to knock
someone else over so that she fell on my leg.  Very sore: today I've
mostly been unable to walk, let alone strap wheels to my feet.  Which
is mostly just really really annoying coming as it does about two days
before the inline marathon.  Unless a miracle has happened by tomorrow
I probably won't be able to take part.
