psql: FATAL:  cannot write init file -- relation tuple form
</pre>

<p>Would it have hurt <i>so</i> much at least to say where this init
file was going to be written?  Maybe also the value of <tt>errno</tt>?
It turns out to mean "/var is full" .

<p>I don't know why I bothered to set this machine up with more than
one partition anyway ...
