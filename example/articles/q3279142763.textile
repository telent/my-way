TODO:
<ul>
<li> Some way to automatically set the optimization qualities in SBCL
that lasts for longer than the current file.  When the current file is
.sbclrc, that's not a very long time
</li>
<li> Write up what the qualities do anyway somewhere (the manual would
be a good place) because I can never remember.
<li> That OpenGL thing from the other day
<li> Another bug (I think it's a PFD thing, but) that I can't remember
<li> <a href="http://www.cliki.net/slime">SLIME</a>-over-networks 
  (preferably sshified)
</li>
</ul>
