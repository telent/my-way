I was going to send a pointer to the preceding (lexically following)
entry to <a href="http://www.dmason.net/">David Mason</a>, long-time
Emacs user and (former?) GNOME project person.  But his web site's
been replaced by a "coming soon" page, and his <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dcm/">Livejournal site</a> (to
get the url of which I had to dig his previous web site out of Google
cache) doesn't display his email address anywhere.  I'd try his old
Red Hat address, but I think it's a matter of principle now.  

<p>On the genreal subject of hiding email addresses, ifile has now
classified 81550 non-spam messages and 637 spam messages.  It gets
about a couple wrong each day - almost always spam that it lets
through into non-spam.  This is a massively better result than
spamassassin already.  So far so good.
