<p>Very quickly then, because I'd really rather be asleep: <a href=
"/slime-backtrace.png">today's SLIME picture</a> shows the expanding
backtrace thing.  No wavey arrows, because this laptop has a
trackpoint thing instead of a mouse, making it far too painful to
attempt drawing anything that's not a straight line.

<p>I believe there's enough substance to the SBCL backend now that I
can start using it for day-to-day work - or at least attempting to, to
see where it falls over.  I would also give you the latest news from
Sourceforge ("Monday"), but their web site seems to be down right now.
