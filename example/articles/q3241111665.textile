Went to the Consume meeting.  Consume is the not-entirely-local local
community 802.11b wireless group (it's in London; even line-of-sight I
doubt I could get a 50 mile point-to-point link).

<p>Consume Live is a lot like you'd expect it to be from the flavour
of the mailing list discusions: that is, it's a loose coalition with
almost as many reasons to participate in a wireless network as there
are people who want to, and it meanders gracefully towards nothing in
particular, occasionally falling into the tar pits of legal arguments
or needless techy fugues.  Blood fugues, almost.  

<p> But we got in a couple of discussions about the aspects I find
genuinely interesting: (a) it has a <a
href="http://consume.net/twiki/bin/view/Main/ConsumeTheNet" >Wiki</a>
which needs some fairly active love and attention (I have a thing for
Wikis, as regular readers know) and (b) service discovery.
