<p> I like to imagine that this diary has a host of dedicated readers
who avidly search each new entry for every clue that might help them
work out what kind of mysterious person I am.

<p> Well, actually, no.  The thought gives me the willies, in fact.
But as a sop to any stalkers in the audience (it would make life
simpler if they would set their User-agents appropriately, then at
least I'd have stats) I can now reveal: the <i>misshapen</i> kind.

<p> I'd never previously noticed, but it's plainly obvious from this
afternoon's endeavours to buy a suit.  If only I'd known earlier, I
could have saved the details from one of those spams advertising
"INCREASE YOUR SIZE BY 2 INCHES GUARANTEED", because, frankly, a 32"
inside leg would give me a lot more choice.
