<p> Double bah.  I thought I'd grabbed a working uncommonsql, but it
turns out to be the one with really dodgy MySQL alien declarations in
it that only really work on Alpha.  Between the API and the
permissions system (it's flexible, just like jelly is flexible) I
really am thinking about moving this stuff to Postgres.  UncommonSQL
is rather better set up with Postgres too, which would be a bonus.
