Shoulder update: it's fine.  No, really.  Just a small yellow bruise;
I have no pain even when I suspend myself from that arm.  Which means
I now have no excuse for further putting off learning to climb.

<p>Mostly due to an extraordinary run of good luck with traffic lights
this evening, I also managed to set a new personal best time from the
office to home this evening: just under 20 minutes, for an average of
29.4 km/h.  If I can get that above 32 km/h (would be "evens", if
there were actually 10 miles between work and home) I'd be very happy
indeed.
