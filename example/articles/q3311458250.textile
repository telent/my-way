Coming soon: cliki rss with <a
href="http://cvs.telent.net/liferea.png">diffs</a>.  All the hard work
has been done already by Nathan Froyd (whose <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/diff" >diff</a> package is
asdf-installable, I hadn't realised) and Christophe Rhodes.  In a
CLiki near you (or, more probably, several at once) just as soon as I
make it show the <i>right</i> diff instead of simply the most recent
one.

<p>This work would not have been possible without the generous support
of the <a href="http://planet.lisp.org/clikis/">Planet Lisp CLiki Edition
beta</a> programme.
