dillo b0rked.   At least, dillo from emacs using my <a href=
"http://ww.telent.net/diary/2003/10/#27.14804" >special recipe</a> now
renders the window, starts a second dillo thread for hostname
resolution, then gets killed by SIGHUP for reasons not completely
obvious to me.  So, no hyperspec lookup, and time for bed.  

<p>Yesterday's entry may have been ambiguous.  I didn't fall on my
shoulder because I was drunk - indeed, I fell on my shoulder several
hours before getting drunk.  I fell while skating, which I claim is in
some way morally superior.
