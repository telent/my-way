Once again I find myself in that place where something that sounds
like a half-hour hack turns out to take all day and still doesn't
work.  This time it's implementing <b>interrupt-thread</b>
(traditionally called <b>process-interrupt</b>), and, being lazy, I'm
going to point you at the <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.devel/1737/"
>sbcl-devel</a> article I wrote earlier this afternoon.  Note two
things since that mail
<ul>

<li> It's conceivable that the context is changing around due to our
interrupting it during a syscall: that whole pc-losering ball of wax

<li> However, after replacing the <b>sleep</b> call (which calls
<tt>select()</tt>) with a call to an infinite loop written in C,
we still get floating-point errors reported.  So, at least there's a
problem we can work on that doesn't involve system calls - and, who
knows, maybe the syscall problem isn't really a problem anyway.
Nobody <i>really</i> uses EAX for anything, do they?
</ul>

<p>Oh, and for completeness' sake, the <a href="/sigrt.c">test
program</a>
