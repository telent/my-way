<p> We can run two threads printing "aaaa" and "bbbb".  Woo.

<p> Unfortunately we can't start a third, because we're starting them
from the toplevel, which is running in the idle thread, which is not
getting scheduled because we're never idle because the other two
threads are running

<p>Or something.

<p>Note to non-lispers: you may be used to the noun <b>process</b>
meaning "unix process with its own address space and stuff".  Due to
its long tradiiton of ignoring^Wdespising Unix, Lisp often uses the
term to mean what Unix people would call a <b>thread</b>.  Neither
side is about to give up, I suspect.  (I tend to use either depending
on how who I'm talking to and how much sleep I've had lately)

<p> Oh, got some cyling done today too: the weather was too nice not
to.  Unfortunately I broke the mounting for my cycle computer after
the first 18 seconds, so I have basically no idea how fast I was going
for the rest of it.  Probably not very.
