<b>CLIKI IS NOT A LIVEJOURNAL SUBSTITUTE</b>

<p>Ahem.  I feel better for having said that, though.

<p>In other news, I've been trying to page SBCL/threads back into my
brain.  This morning in the shower I made the executive decision to
punt on all the POSIX job control stuff

<ul>

<li> It's complicated.  I don't think anyone really ever intended that
multiple tasks produced with CLONE_VM should be in different process
groups.

<li> It's messy to debug.  <tt>ptrace()</tt> reparenting makes
<tt>strace(1)</tt> a lot less useful than it might be, and
<tt>fprintf(stderr,"...")</tt> is not so helpful either when it causes
the process in question to get <tt>SIGTTOU</tt>

<li> It's probably just going to confuse the shell, which expects to
do this stuff itself.
</li>
</ul>

So, decided to adopt a much easier approach towards getting
"non-foreground" threads to ignore ^C: they can ignore SIGINT.  Does
anyone ever send SIGINT other than from the keyboard anyway?  Please
tell me they don't.
