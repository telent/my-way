<b>Lisp/Scheme</b>

<ul>
<li> C/C++
<li> Pascal/Modula-2
<li> Java/ObjC
<li> TeX/LaTeX
<li> C#/dhcpd.conf
<li> Python/Makefile
</ul>

Contributions welcome.  The rules: (1) the two things to suffer
aggregation must have superficially similar syntax and be in other
respects utterly different, (2) the proponents of either or both are
likely to consider the comparison unfair, (3) the judge's decision is
final and no correspondence will be entered into unless I feel like
it.
