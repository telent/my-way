<p>Because, I think, for a language to be considered truly general
purpose it must be good for evil baling-wire-and-duct-tape kludges as
<i>well</i> as for beautiful elegant robust well-engineered solutions,
I have (minimal) pleasure in showing you <a href="/asdf-install.lisp"
>asdf-install.lisp</a> (temporary location).

<p>"Not work-viewable", as they say

<p>Note in passing: the cclan <tt>&gt;(foo)</tt> and <tt>:(download
...)</tt> tokens are both deprecated.  If you follow these rules, you
can use the new <tt>:(package ...)</tt> syntax instead.

<ol>

<li> The CLiki page name must be the asdf system name, after downcasing

<li> The package link is either <tt>:(package "foo.tar.gz")</tt> for
a package in cCLan, or <tt>:(package
"full://url/to/host/foo.tar.gz")</tt> for a package somewhere else

<li> There is only one package link per page

<li> It must point to a gzipped tarball of an <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/ASDF_System" >ASDF System</a> or close approximation

<li> The package must be Free according to DFSG 

</li>
</ol>
