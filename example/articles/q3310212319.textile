I've added a couple of detachtty patches as <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=detachtty"
>bugs in the Debian BTS</a>.  Both are proposed to solve similar
problems, which a third person has now also asked about, so as
detachtty is a debian native package (even though I'm not an official
debian developer) it seems easiest to put them up there until I look
at them.  Then at least anyone else who wants this functionality
doesn't have to go ahead and develop it independently in a vacuum
while I sit around being lazy.
