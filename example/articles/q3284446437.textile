I'm shortly going to be a normal person again.  On the sofa next to me
is a written offer letter from <a
href="http://www.clara.net/">clara.net</a> in which they describe a
money-making scheme requiring only 40 hours of my time each week in
exchange for which they will transfer funds directly into my bank
account once a month.  Which seems like a pretty neat idea compared to
the more usual "do some work, invoice for it, wait a month, phone
customer to enquire whereabouts of cheque, wait two weeks, pay cheque
into bank" arrangement, and I wonder if it will catch on more widely.

<p>Answers to FAQ: (1) in London.  Yes, I probably will move back
there.  (2) A certain amount of trepidation, but flexitime makes it
not so bad, and I can use chemical crutches in the form of unlimited
free coffee to cushion the blow.  (3) AFAICS the contract doesn't
allow it, although it's hard to tell how some of the clauses group:
it's written in legal English and there are no commas anywhere.
Perhaps it only forbids moonlighting when the business is "competing
or tending to compete with the Business of the Company"
