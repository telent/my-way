Somewhere between 2.4.20-pre5-ac3 and 2.4.20-rc2-ac3, the paging
behaviour of Linux changed drastically, to the point where my 128Mb
laptop is no longer comfortable for many of the tasks I use it for.
Alternatively, something else I changed (I'm running Debian unstable
and staying reasonably up to date) is being evil, but I'm reasonably
sure I rebooted more than a few times in the days immediately before
the new kernel (ugly ext3 errors, hence the reason for trying a new
kernel) and didn't notice anything)

<p>top(1) is reporting <i>less</i> swap used than normal, for what
that's worth

<p>New printer arrived.  I'd been quite irrationally excited about its
imminence over the weekend - which is silly, it's not exactly the most
interesting possible purchase ever, even in the field of computer
hardware.  Plugged it in, turned it on, sent it postscript.  It works.

<p>Also over weekend, SBCL threads hacking.  This is, uh, the third or
possibly fourth attempt, and mostly so far consists of some messing
about with segment selectors plus a forward port of the second
(possibly third) attempt, so in spirit could be seen as a continuation
of that one.
