I'm testing bits of the <a
href="http://web.metacircles.com/circle_cd">cirCLe CD</a> using Xnest
and a chroot - it's a lot less painful than rebooting, and even
somewhat less painful than compressing iso9660 images all the time to
run vmware on.  I was mildly amused to find just now that Xnest
has a <a href="/screensaver.png">screen saver</a>
