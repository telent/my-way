--text follows this line--

Mostly bug fixes and other small changes prompted by the recent
defacing of the CLiki front pages by some wazzock from Brazil

* CLiki now depends on Miles Egan's xmls library as well as everything
  else

* Araneida has better support for conditional GET (may save you some
  bandwidth; may even save you some cpu or database time, especially
  if you're using it behind a caching reverse proxy)

New in Araneida 0.83

* Clear up RESPONSE-SENT so that it works as described.

* Convenient support for conditional GET requests: the new keyword
  argument :CONDITIONAL T to REQUEST-SEND-HEADERS will cause it to
  compare the last-modified date in the response with the
  if-modified-since date in the request, sending a 304 response
  and then signalling RESPONSE-SENT when appropriate.

* REDIRECT-HANDLER may now take a relative urlstring for :LOCATION,
  which is merged against the handler's base url

* Cleared up a lot (but not all) of the compilation warnings and
  style-warnings


New in CLiki 0.4.2

* Now depends on xmls package for rss generation (stop complaining at
  the back there: it's small, it's asdf-installable if you ignore the
  lack of GPG key, and it decruftifies the code noticeably)

* Tweaked the feature that allows users to collapse multiple edits to
  the same page such that they only show on Recent Changes once.  Now
  it only works if the two edits happened within ten minutes of each
  other.

* Update README to include web address for lispweb list

* 'Create new page' link to site root, and other links in the default
  HTML stuff fixed (pointed out by Erik Enge, patch from Ivan Toshkov,
  thanks both)

* example.lisp package name changed to something less clashable
