The novelty of being back on the internet has still not entirely
subsided.

<p>I am working on a <a
href="https://www.pubsoft.org/pubsoft.py/project?proj=SBCL-AMD64" >64
bit SBCL for the AMD64</a> (formerly x86-64, n&eacute;e Hammer)
architecture.  So far it makes it successfully through make-host-1
(the cross-compiler) and make-target-1 (the runtime), and all the
offsets and suchlike that genesis spits out look correct - all the
ones I've checked, at least.  Before anyone gets too excited, though,
it is without question utterly broken in several important ways: not
least that I haven't taught it how to generate code for the 64 bit
registers, or taught gencgc about all the interesting new types and widths

<p>I can't help feeling it would be nice if something could be
automated to dig the information that gencgc needs from Lisp.  

<p>TODO list as soon as I take a break from this:
<ul>
<li> cliki index bug 

<li> stargreen behaviour-under-load frobbing

<li> get version-control archive thingies for araneida/cliki "out
there" so that next time my connectivity goes away it doesn't stop
other people from hacking on them.  This <i>may</i> involve learning
<tt>arch</tt>, if its replicated repository stuff means that I get to
hack on them too in such circumstances.

</ul>
