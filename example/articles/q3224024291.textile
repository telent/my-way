<p> Araneida works with asdf.  Total porting time required: about ten
 minutes (I had to do other fixes to make it work with sbcl 0.7 as
 well, but they needed doing anyway).

<p> Created an experimental non-vendor-aligned cClan archive network.
See <a
href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/12820/0/7981131/"
>mail to cclan-list</a> and <a
href="http://cclan.sourceforge.net/debian/experimental/cclan/doc/NEW-NODE"
>node creation instructions</a>.  So far it has one and a half sites
(ftp.linux.org.uk and sourceforge, the latter in a client-only role) and dummy
files, but we'll get some content up soon.  Probably
db-sockets/araneida/cliki, at a guess ...
