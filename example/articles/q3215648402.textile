<P>Today the weather was lovely and I had a chance to get out and ride
my bicycle (in shorts and short-sleeved top, even.  Unusual for a UK
November).  This was the first time in something like three weeks (not
entirely the weather's fault, I've been out of Oxford a lot recently
and lazy when I was here) and I feel <i>much</i> better for it.

<p>As compensation for that, the hard disk in my laptop gave up.
Which was something of a surprise as it wasn't even ill yesterday.
I got a backup which seemed to include most of the important data, but
I managed to lose my package list, so reinstalling onto the new one
took longer than I wanted it to, and there are probably still packages
missing from it that I will find I need.  It has no cclan yet

<p>I took the opportunity to upgrade to emacs 21.  Anyone know how to
get rid of the irritating <a href="vertical-grey-strips.gif">vertical
grey strips</a> down the sides of the frame?
