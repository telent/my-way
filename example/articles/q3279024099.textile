That's not how it ended up, though.  Faced with the prospect of doing
lots of Unixy waitpid() stuff without the benefit of SB-GROVEL, I
punted slightly.  We do all that in the C handler, then call into Lisp
to run <b>handle-thread-exit</b> which frobs <b>*session*</b>, then
destroy_thread() runs from C.  Much simpler, and doesn't involve
interesting design work to

<ul>
<li> copy the siginfo somewhere safe that call-behind handlers can
find it
<li> decide what to do about signal masking during the execution of
the Lisp handlers
</ul>

Now committed in 0.8.6.11 anyway.  CLONE_PARENT is no more.
