I have just come back from my first rollerblading in three years or
so.  It was more fun than I remembered, and obviously not as
difficult: I only fell over once, which evasive manoeuvre was more or
less planned, and involved comparatively<sup>*</sup> little loss of
skin.  Oxford may not have a worthwhile Hyde Park equivalent, but it
still has more smooth pavement than I'd realised.

<p>OK, you'd rather have heard about some kind of low-level SBCL
hacking or something.  Bad luck.

<p><sup>*</sup>compared to, say, last Sunday morning, when I fell over
- sober, which is more than I am now - while showering, and cut my
head on the corner of the towel rail.
