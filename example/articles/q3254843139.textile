So I think I can probably get this into SBCL 0.7.13 (which will be
released on Sunday, all being well) by claiming it's a bugfix for

<pre>
* (require :sb-executable)
NIL
* (with-open-file (o "test1.lisp" :direction :output) (format o "(princ \"hello world\")"))
NIL
* (compile-file "test1")
; compiling file "/home/dan/test1.lisp" (written 21 FEB 2003 07:04:41 PM):

and then in the shell:
<pre>
<font color=green><b>:;</b></font> ./hello
hello world<font color=green><b>:;</b></font> 
<font color=green><b>:;</b></font> time ./hello
hello world
real    0m0.089s
user    0m0.060s
sys     0m0.020s
</pre>

Yes, that bold green thing really is my shell prompt.  The point is
that I can select commands by triple-clicking them and then paste them
into any other xterm.
