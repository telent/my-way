I lied, as it turns out.  On closer inspection, there's been a darcs
repo for <a
href="http://verisons.telent.net/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/dbs/?c=browse">dbs</a>
on verisons.telent.net for most of a year.  Now updated with my latest
bout of hacking - the principal change is that <b>get-row</b> now
{needs,accepts} only one argument.

<p>See the <a
href="http://verisons.telent.net/cgi-bin/darcs.cgi/dbs/README?c=annotate">README</a>
for more.

<p>This stuff is not guaranteed useful, or even suggested useful.
<i>I</i> like it, you are at liberty to like it or not.  Even if you
do, you may not like what it develops into, or the cavalier attitude I
propose to take towards backward compatibility when I see things that
I think could be improved in the course of that development.

<p>(While I'm here: who has sexql patches that I don't?  Please send
them (or put links to them or to your darcs tree or something on cliki))
