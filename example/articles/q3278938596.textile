Just spotted this on lisp-p.org: 
<a href="http://www.lisp-p.org/taga/node1.html"
>Thoughts about Game &amp; Simulation Programming Architecture</a>.
haven't read it yet, it's in the queue

<p>Preceding it in said queue:
<ul>
<li> make QUIT work sensibly when background threads exist
<li> have threads removed from the *interactive-threads* list when
they die
<li> investigate some problem with OpenGL bindings
</ul>

<p>I recently - after only five years ownership of this Voodoo3 - did
the necessary fiddling to get hardware-accelerated 3d (turns out that
I seem to be mostly immune to Tuxracer) so that OpenGL thing looks
like it could be interesting.
