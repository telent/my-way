<a href="http://www.cliki.net/trivial-sockets">trivial-sockets 0.2</a>
is out now.  Available on your preferred cCLan mirror if and when said
mirror next updates from ftp.linux.org.uk (must do something about
that one day: if you recognise a site in the list at the <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/cclan-choose-mirror">cCLan redirector</a>
that's under your nominal control and it doesn't have trivial-sockets
0.2, please either rectify that or mail me and ask to be removed from
the list), it includes client and server socket support for Allegro
CL, CLISP, CMUCL, LispWorks, OpenMCL and SBCL, as well as client-only
support for ABCL.

<p>Some time in the near future I will compile a table containing all
the options involved in the opening-a-socket-stream task that a user might
reasonably want to frob, and all the various common lisp implementations
in which they might want to frob them, and find some way to beat each of
the various vendors around the head until their particular column
is not full of "unimplemented in this lisp".  in the meantime, the 
last section of the <a
href="http://cvs.telent.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trivial-sockets/trivial-sockets.texi?view=markup"
>manual</a> should give you a pretty good idea of what I'm getting at.

<p>0.3 will have timeouts.
