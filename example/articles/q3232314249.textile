<p> I think I'd forgotten how to make <a href="/cliki/vn-cclan"
>vn-cclan packages</a>:
<pre>
* (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'cclan)
* (dolist (s '(araneida cliki)) (cclan::cvs-tag s) (cclan::make-tar-file s))
</pre>

<p>New araneida and cliki packages in your nearest vn-cclan mirror as
soon as they propagate, then

<p>In other news, SBCL for Tru64 appears not to have bitrotted, so I
should be checking that in tomorrow.  Just want to build it with
itself again first.
