<blockquote>
The informal groups' vested interests will be sustained by the
informal structures that exist, and the movement will have no way of
determining who shall exercise power within it. If the movement
continues deliberately not to select who shall exercise power, it does
not thereby abolish power. All it does is abdicate the right to demand
that those who do exercise power and influence be responsible for
it. If the movement continues to keep power as diffuse as possible
because it knows it cannot demand responsibility from those who have
it, it does prevent any group or person from totally dominating. But
it simultaneously ensures that the movement is as ineffective as
possible. Some middle ground between domination and ineffectiveness
can and must be found.

<p>It's actually nothing to do with the Free Software movement
<i>or</i> the Open Source tribe(sic); it was first printed by the
women's liberation movement in 1970.  But, next time I see Eric
Raymond's articles on ZDNet or Cnet or wherever and find myself
muttering things like "<i>I</i> didn't vote for him", well, hmm.
