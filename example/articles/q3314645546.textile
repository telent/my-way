loaclhost.telent.net (a.k.a cvs.telent.net) has a very ill hard disk
and is down until further notice.  Right now I don't even have any
other device I can boot it from (or indeed, media to boot) so I'm
going to have to spend some time finding a cdrom drive and a suitable
Linux Alpha cdrom image to put in it before any further progress is
noted.  Weekend project, i think.

<p>No, I can't just put it in a PC.  (1) I don't have one spare, (2)
the disk uses weirdo Alpha partition tables: the effort involved in
digging out a suitable machine and doing necessary kernel stuff to it
would be better spent on getting the alpha running again.  Yes, it's
possible.  No, "just" is not the right word.
