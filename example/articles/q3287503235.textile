This is not for universal distribution yet, but I'm sure my readership
is sufficiently short of universal (and, I like to imagine, a
civilised, well-mannered subset of the universe that is prepared to
tolerate a degree of unfinishedness and consider ideas on their merits
instead of rejecting them out of hand on the basis of an
ill-thought-out emotional response) that nothing bad will happen if I
tell you guys what I've been doing lately.

<p>(Yes, it is legal.  Well, what I'm about to talk about is legal.  I'm
not sure that the rollerblading in bus lanes which I have also been
doing lately is likewise legal, but that's not germane as I'm not
about to talk about that)

<p>So, this is <i>not</i> an announcement of <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/cirCLe" >The cirCLe Project</a> Version 2 -
whose goal is to produce the cirCLe distribution, version 0 - but you
might want to take a look anyway.
