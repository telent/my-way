In the Olden Days when I was writing FTX13, I used periodically to
report on new versions of <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/"
>LISA</a>, a production rule system for Common Lisp.  As with so much
of the other stuff that went into FTX13 I'd never actually downloaded
it to try for myself, so these reports tended just to recycle whatever
the project release notes said.   The accrued boredom and low-level guilt 
from doing this over a six month period was one of the factors in
giving up FTX13.

<p> So, there's a new version of LISA out today (1.3), and I
<i>still</i> haven't looked at it, and i still feel vaguely uneasy
about this.  Anyway, you can probably determine whether it's useful
for you: see e.g. <a href="http://lisa.sourceforge.net/mab-clos.lisp"
>mab-clos.lisp</a>
