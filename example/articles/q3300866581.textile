Fell over.

<p>Yes, indeed.  In my devotion to providing <i>you the reader</i>
with a constant stream of drivel to read here, I tripped while skating
through the underpass last night when someone fell in front of me.
Lost some few square inches of skin from my left elbow, ruined a
tshirt, and fortuitously for blogging purposes managed to damage my
shoulder in some way that makes it hurt when I raise my arm.  Yes,
again.  Other shoulder this time, though.  So, expect lots of entries
typed partly onehanded with unnecessary details about bruise sizes.

<p>Actually, I can't see any bruising yet.  Thi might just be because
it hasn't had time to develop yet, or I fell in some way that didn't
involve a bruise, or my messing about with compression and random
items from the freezer actually had an effect.

<p>Oh well.  It upstages wrist twinges, however you look at it.
