OK, more content on web.metacircles.com: <a
href="http://web.metacircles.com/scripting_emacs" >Scripting Emacs</a>
is an article I wrote for Linux User &amp; Developer magazine last
spring (published last summer, as is the way with magazine lead
times).  The "&amp; Developer" part of their magazine doesn't get 
as far as their web site, so here's a small bit of it on mine.

<p>I have written other stuff for them too, which I might post sooner
or later.  That said, the CLiki article is probably out of date, and
the SBCL threads article doesn't tell you anything that reading the
paper from my <a href=
"http://www.ukuug.org/events/linux2003/prog/abstract-DBarlow-1.shtml"
>UKUUG presentation</a> wouldn't.  Of course it, too, is out of date.
That's the price of progress.  Or something.
