<p>New release (0.4) of net-telent-date.  I always feel slightly guilty
about the name of this package: I named it when I was on a bit of a
"all packages should have guaranteed-unique names, and using the dns
is the best way to ensure this" kick, but most of the actual code in
it is in fact lifted from CMUCL, so calling it something with 'telent'
in the name is in a certain light tantamount to passing off.  Oh well.

<p>Anyway, new function universal-time-to-rfc2822-date, which attempts
to do local time.  It follows the existing practice of decode-universal-time
for its argument list, which essentially means there are only two ways
to use it that don't require a teatowel wrapped around the neck to avoid
dribbling brain on the floor:

<ol>
<li> without the optional argument, you get local time
<li> with <tt>0</tt> as the optional argument, you get UTC (or GMT)
</li>
</ol>
