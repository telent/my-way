Two years after I first started hacking on CMUCLish stuff, I still
don't understand the CMUCL compilation procedure.

<p>(Actually I don't understand a lot of the SBCL compilation procedure
either, but that's ok, because I don't need to - it Just Works (tm))

<p>Eric Marsden is about to tell us all how it works.  Once he manages to
get the projector working with his Powerbook, anyway.
