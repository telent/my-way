<p> Yes, it was related.  Not only do we need to jump to the right
address, but we need to set r19 (reg_Code) to the Function object for
that address.  Now, owing to really bad address punning on the part of
the CMUCL PPC port, we can actually use the Function object as a place
to jump to.  We just weren't - instead we were using the raw-address
slot in the Fdefn object.  This stuff is non-obvious to me, really.
