Owing to an accounting screwup (which may actually have been my fault,
for a change), my cablemodem service stopped at around 2pm today, NTL
obviously preferring to switch everything off than to e.g. attempt to
contact the customer in such circumstances.  Having resolving this in
the space of about half an hour - most of it in various kinds of
queues, 14 hours later my service has still not been reconnected.
"By the end of the day", they said.  Ha.

<p>Apparently the customer service people (who have the authority to
reconnect) don't have access to the same computer systems as the
technical support department (who actually have the ability) and have
to send <i>email</i> to effect this.  My guess is that the email in
question is stuck behind a zillion bounces and a virus checking
bottleneck, and I should plan for the return of my The Infinite
Distraction That Is Internet service sometime on Friday.  In the
meantime I'm reduced to 56k modem on a noisy (and pay-per-minute)
analogue line, so for the most part not on irc.

<p>I <i>think</i> I got more work done without net than I typically
(or at least, often) do with it.  But on the other hand, anyone who
wanted to look at cvs.telent.net couldn't.  Bad luck, anyone.
