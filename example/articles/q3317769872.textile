I'd like to add a postscript to the preceding: this is not set in
stone.  (1) I'll probably hack it for some looser equality predicate
than EQ.  (2) To cope with uses like <tt>(incf (ref thing :el))</tt>
it would be very nice to pass an optional default.  Now is however not
the time to decide which arg the default will be, but it's looking
kind  of non-obvious at present.
