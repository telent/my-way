<p>How to write error messages, part <i>n</i>: when reporting
filesystem errors, include the pathname of the associated file. 
We take our example, as usual, from Oracle.

<pre>
ORA-00443: background process "PMON" did not start
ORA-09922: Can't spawn process - background log directory not created properly
Intel SVR4 UNIX Error: 2: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p>Which is to say, not like that.
