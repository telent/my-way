Announcing the TRIVIAL-SOCKETS interface for undemanding network clients.

<p> Having once already tried to define a flexible networking
interface that would anticipate most of the weird stuff that people
might want to do with an underlying BSD sockets interface, I'm now
going to the other extreme: TRIVIAL-SOCKETS has one exported function,
which takes a hostname and port to connect to and returns a stream.

<pre>
FOO> (with-open-stream (s (trivial-sockets:open-stream "www.google.com" 80))
       (format s "HEAD / HTTP/1.0~%Host: www.google.com~%~%")
       (force-output s) 
       (read-line s))
"HTTP/1.0 200 OK
"
</pre>

OK, you get the idea.  Mostly unimplemented so far (it kind of works
on SBCL, but not totally), but please see texinfo spec and so forth at
<a href="http://cvs.telent.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trivial-sockets/"
>http://cvs.telent.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trivial-sockets/</a>.  It's
never going to be sb-bsd-sockets, but we could still aspire to write a
spec in English that's a bit tighter than the CLOCC PORT stuff.  And
make it asdf-installable, of course.
