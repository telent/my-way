The latest iteration of my standard c.l.l rant:

<pre>

<p>Meanwhile it's a quality-of-life disadvantage for every software
system you use but are not in competition with the suppliers of.  I
regularly use or am affected by the workings of many many more
computer systems than I have any hope of personally reimplementing in
Lisp, and every time one of them fucks up it affects me.

<p>When I can find Lisp-using alternatives for my desktop software, all
the web sites I visit regularly, my bank, my government, the utilities
that provide my gas, electricity, and telephone service, the shops I
buy groceries from, the airlines and travel agents who organise my
vacations and business travel, and all the thousands of other computer
users who impact on my daily life, then I'll buy this "popularity
doesn't matter" argument.  Until then, I have to (and for that matter,
choose to) exist in a social environment, and I suspect that the same
is true even for entrepreneurs.
