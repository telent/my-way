My intention today was to hack a couple of fixes into CLiki such that
there's a reasonable time limit on the "you can amend a prior edit
without it appearing again in Recent Changes" feature, because I
believe that's what our friend from Brazil was doing.  Also to get on
with some Stargreen testing. 

<p>So what I did <i>instead</i> was teach SLIME to compile ASDF
systems.  This is still ongoing, but you can see the
