<p> More PPC, la la la.   
<ol>
<li> the make-closure vop wasn't filling in the header word correctly

<li> anonymous call was jumping to an address based on the closure not
the function (makes a difference if it really is a closure)

<li> set-fdefn-function was storing the function instead of
function+offset in the raw-addr slot

<li> lisp-jump still looks odd even if it appears to be working.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Fixes 1 and 2 cured yesterday's problem; I'm hoping that fix 3
should fix the next bug to come along if I rebuild it cleanly, but
I've already tried a simple make-host-2 with no success, so I'm not
entirely expecting it will.

<p> Also driving lesson, but but more about that tomorrow when I've
taken the test.
