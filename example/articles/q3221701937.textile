<p> Not a terribly successful week, code-wise.  

<p> SBCL Alpha 0.7 has a bug whereby setf of (get 'nil 'anything) will
cause all error reporting henceforth to break, which apart from
anything else means it can't be used to build itself.  Discovered this
when attempting to rebuild with -dynamic so that I could use clg with it.

<p> SBCL PPC (still 0.6.13) doesn't build itself either, blowing up in
second genesis when it attempts to load a specialised array with an
element size of 0.  I suspect we may still be having byte ordering
issues.

<p> Raymond Wiker's CLX for SBCL works nicely, though.  It had most of
a working set of dependencies for db-sockets already, so sent him some
code to open the stream to $DISPLAY and thereby remove its foreign
code dependency.
