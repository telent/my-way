In a spirit of 'release early, release often', I have decided to start
making new araneida/cliki/etc releases more or less as often as I fix
bugs, except when I definitely know it to be in a broken state.  This
is as distinct from my previous approach of only releasing when I was
at least moderately confident that it would work, which meant that I
never released anything

<p>Of course, the Internet (or perhaps NTL) has chosen the occasion of
this decision to break, so 

It might also be the impetus I need to hone my release procedure a
bit further.
