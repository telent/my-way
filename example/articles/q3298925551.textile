I'm finding more SBCL threading bugs: so far, the count is three bugs
and two fixes.

Edi Weitz <a href=

>pointed out</a> recently that his cl-ppcre libarry comes with a test
suite whose threading tests fail when run under SBCL, so I've been
working on that.  So far

<ol>
<li> Bad header file ordering in the runtime was causing the
non-threaded versions of spinlock get/release inline functions to be
compiled in some places even on a threaded build.  (Fixed)

<li> SIGCHLD will call destroy_thread, which is fair enough, but not if
you're holding all_threads_lock already because it wants to acquire
it.  (Fixed)

<li> After beating on the threading for long enough it's still somehow
possible to get into a state where GC wants to stop a thread so that
it can collect the heap, but the thread has disappeared.  Not fixed

</li>
</ol>
