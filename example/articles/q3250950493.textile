Happy New Year.  Probably.

<p>Much shuffling of web site stuff around

<ul>

<li> the Local Food Directory got another round of hacking - a
side-effect of which is that other <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/">Cliki</a>-based sites get summaries
showing the matched text in <a
href="http://www.cliki.net/admin/search?words=barlow" >search result
pages</a>

<li> <a href="http://web.metacircles.com/" >metacircles</a> got
vigorously spring-cleaned, to the point that I'm no longer
<i>completely</i> ashamed of it

<li> and <a href="http://www.cliki.net/CLiki%20News" >cliki
changes</a> too: the long-requested "create a new page unlinked from
anywhere" button.  Needs javascript, because I'm too lazy to do it
server-side
</li>
</ul>

<p>The good news is that I got a call today from Carphone Warehouse to
say that my phone is back from having been <a href=
"http://ww.telent.net/diary/2002/12/#19.4622">away to get fixed</a>.
I haven't picked it up yet, though.  I hope this time they've actually
repaired it properly.

<p>Current TODO: VAT return, and release new packages of cliki and all
its dependent stuff.
