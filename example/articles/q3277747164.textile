So I finally upgraded my desktop to 2.6 (2.6.0-test9), at least, after
fiddling a bit so that it's still using the old OSS-style sound module
instead of spiffy new Alsa.  This is because spiffy new Alsa doesn't
work, as far as I can tell: there seems to be no way to persuade my
motherboard to put the video card (Voodoo3) and the onboard audio in
different interrupts: ye olde technologie trident.o can cope with
sharing, but ALSA snd-trident makes some really really evil noises
every time I select a menu item in Mozilla.  Anyway, that's an
exploration for another day.

<p>What this means immediately is that it's time to play with futexes.
