<p> Well, let's see.  Now we're using the software fp_control
register, with ffi calls to read and write it using
<tt>ieee_[sg]et_fp_control()</tt>.  We've lost the ability to set the
rounding mode, but the evidence so far available suggests that only
insane people want to do that anyway.  The rest appears to be working,
except that in sigfpe-handler we're using the current fp_control
instead of the one in the sigcontext.  This is because (according to
grep *.[chS], anyway) the kernel appears not to ever fill in the
sc_fp_control slot in the sigcontext.  The one I looked at certainly
didn't seem to contain the right answer.

<P> OK, so we have more-working-than-it-was Alpha floating point, at
least.  In fact, as we actually look up which trap went off when we
get a SIGFPE, we presently have more featured fp support on Alpha than
we do on x86.  Someone who cares can fix up x86 equivalently.
