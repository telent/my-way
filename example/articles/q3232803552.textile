<p>Well, that'd explain it.  Mail from the Userland people to say that
the aggregator is no longer running.  A note to that effect on the web
site would have been <i>nice</i>, but never mind.

<p>I was pointed to Meerket at O'Reilly, but it doesn't actually have
any "submit your rss url here" option of its own, it relies on
grovelling the userland and xmltree.com databases.  Given that one of
these no longer exists and the other is some lameass hierarchical
thing ...  Enough.  If/when the RSS advocates get their collective act
together, I'll have another look.  Until then, back it goes in the box
with SET, Java applets, "wallets", and VRML.  Sorry.
