OK, a single session transcript doesn't really capture the kewlness
aspect of this, so, my turn to put some <a href="/threads.png">Lisp
pr0n</a> up.  Caution: actually not that visually stimulating after
all.  Also, it's a big (as in, 1280x960 pixels) picture.

<p>Clockwise from top right:
<ul>

<li> The initial toplevel window, chock full of important debugging
printf.  Observe, though, that it's in the break loop, and that this
has not stopped the other threads from running

<li> an xterm showing ps output with lots of sbcl processes in it

<li> a window on the emacs *shell1* buffer, which is attached to a
thread that incfs the global variable <tt>*global*</tt> every second

<li> a window on the emacs *shell* buffer, which is displaying a
message referring to said <tt>*global*</tt> once a second.


</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, <i>I</i> think it's cool.  I'm not about to start producing
mpegs, though; you may just have to take my word for it that all of
this is updating at once.

<p>(Or you could check the cvs branch out and try it yourself, of
course)
