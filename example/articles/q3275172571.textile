No slime today, because I haven't been working on it.  No slime on
sourceforge, and no explanation for its continued missingness.  No

them after the project had been created, or anything.  No, they
definitely need to be in place at project creation time.


<p>For the record, I'm not at all sure that the requirement to include
a copy of the GPL is appropriate in this case.  The cited reason is
that the user may not have one already; however, we are talking about
Emacs lisp here - slime would be pretty useless without Emacs, which
package tends as a rule to come with a GPL copy of its own.

<p>The good news is that I think I've fixed the longstanding cliki bug
with page names that have % or . or + or similar exciting characters
in them.  No, don't go and test it, I haven't released the new version
or upgraded any of the public sites yet.
