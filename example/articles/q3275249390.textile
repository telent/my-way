We have <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME
CVS</a> again, now at <a href="http://www.common-lisp.net/"
>common-lisp.net</a>

<p>Sourceforge also finally managed to recreate the project, two
minutes after Luke sent them the support request saying "we don't need
this any more, we've taken it elsewhere".

<blockquote>
As you have requested the removal of your project, your project has
now been set aside in a queue to be purged of data. This purge cycle
typically occurs every two to three months.  In the mean time, CVS
data, project web content, mailing lists, file releases and cron jobs
related to your project will remain intact
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the project having been recreated empty, there isn't a
lot of "CVS data, project web content, mailing lists, file releases
and cron jobs" there in the first place.
