<p>It was a fixup problem (again).  Having successfully proved that there
was nowhere I was writing #x47, but that said octet nevertheless
appeared in the output, there were only as many suspects as there were
places that rewrite bits of the generated code before it's dumped.

<p>I found that out about a week ago, and haven't looked at AMD64
since, owing to being absurdly busy - mostly busy sitting on public
transport journeying to and from London, admittedly, but with a laptop
that (a) runs for about 40 minutes on a full battery, (b) isn't amd64
anyway, that's basically just downtime.

<p>Job continues fine.  Weekend consumed mostly by araneida/postgresql
performance experimentation (I'd like to say "tuning", but that
implies a goal and a sense of direction largely absent from my
meanderings)
