&lt;bziki__> why am i complaning ???  i'll tell you why.  because the
+attitud of the room sucks. you guys are really not trying to help, you
+are just try to educate user i how to learn. and that is not part of
+this idea. the idea behind these chat rooms is whenever someone has
+already looked in the books/docs/mans and did not find what he/she
+needed - or - he/she are in serious need for immdiate help.
