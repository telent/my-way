<p>Obviously I should be charging it with the power off ...

<blockquote>
It has been reported by some of our customers that they have
experienced reduced battery life after charging their Zen Micro. Our
product development team has researched these reports and determined
that the users may have experienced this after they plugged their Zen
Micro into the AC adapter that was already inserted into a wall socket
with the AC power on.

<p>While this is not the conventional way to plug in a player for
charging, we wanted to ensure that our customers did not experience
this problem, so we have developed a solution to address this, which
simply involves upgrading the Zen Micro's firmware.
