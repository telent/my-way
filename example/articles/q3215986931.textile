<p> Accounts day.  More accurately, accounts day 1.  Double-entry
bookkeeping contains too many double negatives for me to believe that 
any human factors expertise was involved when they invented the
system.

<p>It was invented in Florence, I'm told.  I don't know that the
Italians are necessarily any better or worse at this stuff than anyone
else, though.
