Train number two, then.  The two ticket inspectors who've looked at my
ticket so far have not commented on the bit that says "Route: NOT
READING".  Perhaps that only restricts people who get off at
Reading: I've now been through said station twice, in opposite
directions, but have remained on the train.  Or perhaps they could
sense I was looking to start an argument and wisely didn't comment.
