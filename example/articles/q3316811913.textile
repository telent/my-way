NO MORE EVIL RECURSIVE BUSTUP.  Problem was due to calling <a href=
"http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/pthread_getspecific.html"
>pthread_getspecific</a> in call_into_lisp without first saving some
registers it wanted to trash.  Juho helpfully <a href=
"http://paste.lisp.org/display/5647" >pointed out another
crappy-editing-induced potential bug</a>, too.  Obviously it's bedtime.
