<p>And since I'm sort of in a blogging frame of mind, I'll mention why
there's been no update here for the past week and a bit: I was skiing.
I spent a whole week in Tignes (French Alps) learning to ski and
didn't break <i>anything</i> - obviously I was being over-cautious.  I
did however lose my glasses on the slope on the second day, so since
then (up until about five minutes ago, when a replacement pair turned
up from the optician) have been walking around wearing sunglasses all
the time - my only spare pair are tinted.

<p>I'd do a comparison between skiing and skating, but really it'd be
like trying to compare CL with Scheme, and I just spent all day
telling people on IRC not to do that.  (Memo to employers: not
<i>all</i> day, really.  Just the idle bits during slow cvs
operations).  But I think it's fair to say that if you like one, the
other might well also appeal.
