&lt;lemonodor> thanks for not notifying me about my dns service expiring,
dotster.
&lt;lemonodor> so anyway, if lemonodor.com doesn't work there's
<a href="http://heavymeta.dyndns.org/">heavymeta.dyndns.org</a> as a fallback

I'll write some more text that's not PRE-formatted soon, I promise.
In the meantime, this has been a public service announcement for
whatever portion of the Lisp screenshot pr0n audience also read my
SBCL ramblings.  Spread the news.
