<p> Spring is here, tra la la.

<p> Well, near enough.  When I stepped outside at 2pm, the temperature
was above zero, and it was not raining.  So, first bike ride of the
year.  <p> I am <i>so</i> out of condition.  Average 27km/h (down from
32 last summer) and now it feels like there is a big hole in my chest
where my lungs used to be.  So, it can only get better from here.  It
had better.

<p> Some SBCL progress yesterday, but more staring at PPC assembler
still needed.  After a certain amount of it, I gave up, cooked dinner,
and reread the fourth Harry Potter book.  Ho hum.

<p> And the days are getting longer again.  It's still light at 16:30
now.
