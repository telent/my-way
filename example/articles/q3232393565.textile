<p> We have another vn-cclan mirror: <a
href="ftp://www.aarg.net/pub/cclan/" >ftp://www.aarg.net/pub/cclan/</a>.
Prompted by this encouraging result and the hope that it presages more
to come, I hacked at telent.net's 
<a href="/cclan-choose-mirror">CCLAN redirector</a> so that now you
can get rid of your earlier choice and select another without having
to fiddle around with cookies.txt or something

<p> I found something that I'm reasonably convinced is an actual SBCL
bug while rebuilding on OSF/1.  <tt>interrupt_maybe_gc</tt>
establishes that the gc trigger has been hit.  It clears the trigger,
calls the Lisp function <tt>MAYBE-GC</tt>.  <tt>MAYBE-GC</tt> calls
<tt>SUB-GC</tt>, which if <tt>*GC-INHIBIT*</tt> is set, returns
immediately without resetting the trigger - which it would have done
had it actually GCed.  So, after that we cons until we run straight
off the end of dynamic space.  I fixed it by making
<tt>interrupt_maybe_gc</tt> check whether a GC had happened, and  
resetting the trigger itself if it hadn't, but I think that's probably
more of a kludge than a fix.
