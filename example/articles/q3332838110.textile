I've been playing with <a
href="http://maps.telent.net/rs-20050814.html" >Google Maps</a>.  The
link you see there is notable less for what you can see (though the
satellite view is kind of neat) as what you would be able to see if
you - for example - were to type 'javascript:showMarkers()' into the
url bar immediately after visiting it.  Probably only works in
Mozilla-derived browsers, or at least has not been tested in anything
else.

<p>Anyway, that's where I'll be leading 100-odd skaters (some odder
than others, I have no doubt) on Sunday afternoon.

<p>In the process I noted quite a lot of one-way streets that are
incorrectly marked in Google Maps, which is a shame as it does rather
reduce the usefulness of said tool for skate route planning of this
kind.

<p>It would be nice if it measured distance: that will be forthcoming.
Yes, I do know about the gmap pedometer, but that only allows the last
point to be edited, whereas this thing allows intermediate points to
be moved/inserted/deleted - and is a bit easier to get the data out of
in useful format.
