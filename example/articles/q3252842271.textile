<p>Again, the new machine comes with Red Hat, and after ascertaining that
it boots using grub and an initrd I really don't fancy replacing it
with Debian remotely.  But nor, to be honest, do I want to continue
depending on a probably-soon-to-be-unsupported Red Hat version for
anything beyond a bare minimum set of services. 

<p>Some slightly cool URLs :

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/chroot.html"
>http://people.debian.org/~walters/chroot.html</a></li>
<li><a href="http://capricorn.woot.net/~jdrew/debian-chroot.html"
>http://capricorn.woot.net/~jdrew/debian-chroot.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>and another useless error message for the collection:

<pre>
Jan 29 15:16:52 eval sshd[878]: PAM rejected by account configuration[9]: Authentication service cannot retrieve authentication info.
</pre>

<p>(In this case, it turns out to mean "when you renamed the user
you're trying to ssh in as, you forgot to update the <tt>shadow</tt>
file")

<p>Most of my time lately has been wrestling with posix job control
stuff, so that multithreaded SBCL behaves somewhat less than
completely stupidly when two threads want to read from the same tty at
once.  Not incredibly exciting, although I might some time soon be
persuaded to write a few words about the xterm -S option before I
forget how it works again.
