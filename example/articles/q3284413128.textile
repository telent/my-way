Some progress on AMD64: the cross-compiler has managed to
cross-compile something

<pre>
; compiling file "/opt/home/dan/src/sourceforge/sbcl/src/code/show.lisp" (written 02 OCT 2002 06:09:17 AM):
; compiling top level form: 
; compiling function SB!INT::CANNOT-/SHOW: 
; recognizing DEFUN CANNOT-/SHOW
; compiling top level form: 
; compiling top level form: 
; compiling DEFMACRO /SHOW: 
; compiling top level form: 
</pre>

The code that it's generating is, I have no doubt, seriously bogus,
but hey!  It's code!  At that point it fails with

<pre>
debugger invoked on a SIMPLE-ERROR in thread 27960:
    failed AVER: "(NOT (EQ SIZE QWORD))"
</pre>

which comes from the MOV case for big immediate constants which checks
they're not 64 bit immediate constants - seems that at leastg one of
them is.  On the basis of the bits of amd64 manual I've read so far it
seems that I can only load a 64 bit constant into rax and not into any
other register, which is a shame, because the backtrace says it wanted
to use rbx.  Perhaps it's bedtime.

<pre>
&lt;rtoy3> It compiles!  Ship it!
