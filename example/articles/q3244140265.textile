<p>My tux didn't come back from the cleaners.  An old friend came in
from out of town.  Someone stole my car!  There was an earthquake!  A
terrible flood!  Locusts!  It wasn't my fault!

<p>Well, no.  Actually I was in Greece, without computers or network
access.  And it was fun, and it was relaxing, and it was warm (I got
slightly sunburnt; not seriously) and it's kind of nice to be back, in
a way, but the weather in England is not that way.  So anyway, that's
why no diary entries for the past week and a bit (sure, you cared) 
nor likely to be much retrospective writing.  Oh, if you insist

<blockquote>
Lay on beach.
</blockquote>

Repeat as necessary.

<p>Now I have the local food directory, entomotomy, a new
araneida/cliki release to package, some domain name registration stuff
to sort out, an ILC talk to do slides for, and a stack of washing, all
by Friday.  And grand ideas for an annotating server thingy based on
cliki, which will probably end up being an example in the ILC talk.
