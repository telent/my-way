<p>Some day I will learn how to release new versions of stuff into
vn-cclan.  Today's trick (repeatedly) has been to forget to do the cvs
commit before making the tar file.  And to upload the wrong tar file
at least once, I suspect.  Not sure how that happened

<p>Still, today's db-sockets 0.57 fixes a bug in yesterday's 0.55 (and
all previous versions, in fact) when used with SBCL 0.7.7 or any other
compiler that actually checks the syntax of <b>defgeneric</b> forms
