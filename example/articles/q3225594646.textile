<p> <a href="http://www.lemonodor.com/#000069">lemonodor</a> has been
having trouble with multiprocessing in CMUCL, and comes to the
conclusion that it is `just barely "production quality"'.  For the
record, the site that served you this page is running on the pretty
similar SBCL (you wouldn't guess) using Araneida, and doesn't even use
MP, instead hooking into the same event loop as SBCL uses for IO at
the top-level.  It does have Apache in front of the CL web server to
act as a proxy, which tends to avoid most of the "slow/malicious
client" problems.

<p> Of course a lot of it comes down to traffic volume.  telent.net
only gets 1000 hits a day or so, evenly spread through 24 hours,
though the other site I'm using Araneida for gets maybe 2-3 times
that, concentrated around GMT lunchtimes and evenings.  That site is 
limited by database access speed (and some really quite suboptimal
queries in places don't help).  ApacheBench has made it do 40-50
requests/second without hurting, but that's not exactly a real-world
load.

<p>SBCL MP will of course solve all the problems of the world if only
I can get as far as implementing it ...
