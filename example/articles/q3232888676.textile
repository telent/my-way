This entry exists for two reasons:

<ol>

<li> To counter <a
href="http://www.neilvandyke.org/weblog/#12-jun-2002" >Neil's
claim</a> that my <a href="/diary/2002/6#11.54534">use of an external
process</a> to generate seconds-since-1900 was an attempt to bait
him.  In fact, it was simply a lack of success with emacs apropos
facility.

<li> To remind me that my permalink format sucks when there are
multiple entries on any given day.  That needs fixing.
</li>
</ol>
