<p>The standard Perl wisdom is that There's More Than One Way To Do It. 

<p>In Lisp there are often also many ways to do the same thing.  At a
low level you'll often see people on comp.lang.lisp or wherever
comparing approaches: debating loop vs do, or the finer points of
format strings, or closures vs objects, or recursive vs iterative
solutions (for the record, tail-recursion is <i>not</i> the Holy
Grail; if the problem is natureally recursively decomposed, use
recursion.  Otherwise just write a loop, already.  And these debates
just tend to help everyone involved to acquire a more complete
picture of the language.

<p>At a higher level, of course, there are many different strategies
for solving the problem, but where in Perl you might go with that
other well-known saying "the Right Answer is whatever lets you get
your job done" (aside: I'm sure I remember hearing this all the time;
now I can't find a single instance of it on Google.  Maybe I'm
assigning too more pragmatism to the Perl Way than I ought; sorry,
guys), in CL you typically (at least, I typically) spend a bit more
thinking time upfront to decide on an elegant solution.

<p>I appear to be suffering choice paralysis.
