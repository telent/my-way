<p> Threading: see <a

We can run a repl in a thread.  We can run threads that read and write
from files.  We have a working SLEEP function.

<p>Still need lots of process control stuff (run/arrest reasons,
killing a running thread, pause/continue, etc).  Still need a locking
implementation that does more than a NOP.  Still need to find the
cause of some as-yet unexplained segvs.  Would <i>like</i> to find out
why we need to zero unused portions of control stack quite as often as
we do, given that GC only scavenges the active bit anyway.

<p>In the course of recompiling it yesterday I managed to run my host
compiler out of dynamic space.  OK, so also need (1) a host compiler
with bigger spaces (building now) and slightly more graceful
out-of-space behaviour than an unexplained segmentation fault.

<p>In other news, I think I pulled a muscle somewhere in my neck, or
something.  Falling asleep on the sofa was not such a smart idea, I
guess.
