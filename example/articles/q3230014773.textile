<p> I still can't get sound working on the blasted thing, though.  I
have vague recollections of <tt>dmasound_pmac</tt> being the
appropriate thing on a previous kernel, but now - well, it works
apparently perfectly in all respects except that of actually producing
audible output.  Yes I <i>have</i> tried a mixer.

<p>Score one for kernel audio drivers, though.  I then tried alsa and
it locked the machine solid.  Hmm

<p>So after that I tried my laptop, but its icky i810_audio stuff
doesn't understand full-duplex.  The card in the Alpha does, but that
machine is firmly ensconced in the rats nest of stuff under the desk
and is not about to get lugged downstairs to be near the guitar.  <a

thing</a> looks rather slick, though.  And cheaper from the <a
href="http://www.apple.com/uk/thestore/" >Apple Store</a> than either
of MikroAnvika or Technomatic.  How long it'll take to arrive, though,
I have no idea.  In the meantime I can get some software-type stuff
written.  I'm sure it's not really necessary to drop into C just to do
audio processing (and if it is, it's time to do some SBCL hacking to
fix that)
