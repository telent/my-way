See if that helps.  Permalink format is now
<tt>/diary/year/month/#date.nnn</tt> where nnn is the number of seconds
since midnight.  Numbers are not zero-padded; it'll only cause trouble
if people want to do arithmetic on them in javascript.

<p>Yes, this is not a backward-compatible change.  I could have (did,
briefly) special-cased the links for old entries, but then I realised
that the only external link that I knew of was not going to the 
<a href="/diary/2002/6/#11.54534">right place</a>
<i>anyway</i>, so really we'll all be happier in the long run
with a Fresh Start.
