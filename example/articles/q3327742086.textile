<b>NOT MORE CONSUMERISM</b>

<p>Latest in the ongoing <a href="">Zen Micro</a> story:
<blockquote>
<b>Update</b>

Oops! After people began installing the firmware update, they began
experiencing problems, like the battery dying when the headphones are
left plugged in. Creative pulled the update from their Web site,
saying that you should re-install the older 1.02.05 if you experience
problems.

<p>So, in fixing the bug that made it not charge when plugged into a
charger which was already turned on, they managed to add a bug that
makes it discharge when the headphones are plugged in.  Fucking
<i>genius</i>.

<p>Needless to say I find this extremely amusing.  That said, I might
appreciate the joke even more if I hadn't already done the upgrade (or
had or could still find a copy of the previous firmware version).
