</blockquote>

Trying to use <a href="/cliki/detachtty">detachtty</a> as an inferior
lisp in <a href="http://sf.net/projects/ilisp">ilisp</a>.  Superficially it
works, but had trouble deciding what state the lisp process is in
until I told it to "repair connection", after which I got the message
above.  Seems better, anyway

<p>Of course, running ilisp on a machine with no access to the sources
I actually want to edit is probably not such a really great idea
anyway.  Oh well.
