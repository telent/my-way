Currently wondering whether we can rewrite the ALLOCATION function and
friends so that OAOOM is less of a concern.  At present it involves lots of
cut &amp; pasted x86 assembler functions with names matching
<tt>alloc_{8_,16_,}to_e{ax,bx,cd,dx,si,di}</tt>), and if I
<i>can't</i> then I need to copy and paste the code another eight
times to cater for r8-r15.
