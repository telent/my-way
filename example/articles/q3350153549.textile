I am the world's biggest plist fan.  Possibly.  Anyway, as part of the
same tidying up process that led to the release of trivial-sockets
0.3, also new to the world but not to me is net-telent-date 0.42,
which has the additional function decode-universal-time/plist.  Just
because I can't always remember the order of the values in a decoded
universal-time (and sometimes you just want the month and year
anyway).
<pre>
(let ((dt (net.telent.date:decode-universal-time/plist (get-universal-time))))
  (format nil "~2,'0D:~2,'0D:~2,'0D ~D/~D/~D"
	  (<a href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2005/2/#19.7584">ref</a> dt :hour) (ref dt :minute) (ref dt :second)
	  (ref dt :year) (ref dt :month) (ref dt :day)))
=> "22:19:16 2006/2/28"
</pre>
