Of course, when one thread wants to talk to <tt>#&lt;FILE-STREAM for
"the terminal" {9004749}></tt> and another wants to talk to
<tt>#&lt;FILE-STREAM for "standard input" {9004539}></tt>,  how does
Lisp know they're actually the same file underneath it all?  They even
have different descriptors.

<p>We can use fstat and test device/inode for equality, I guess.  It's
going to lose on sockets (not on Linux, by inspection, but e.g. OSX
has no inodes for sockets) and probably other stuff too.  In the worst
case all we really need to support is ttys (and tell people to use
ptys if they want sane interactive behaviour) but it hurts to be so
ugly.
