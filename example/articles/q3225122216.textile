<p> Lloyds TSB just phoned me up to arrange an account review.  I
haven't had an account with them for several months, having closed it
due to their complete indifference, insincere form letters, rapacious
charges, and general unhelpfulness.  If I'd known then that they would
do this <i>afterwards</i>, I could have added "basic incompetence" to
that list.

<p> Courtesy of the <a href="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/" >Compaq
Testdrive</a> programme, I tested infinities in CMUCL on Digital Unix.
CMUCL 18a, because that was the latest version I could find

<pre>
;;; ev56-based machine
*  (sqrt SINGLE-FLOAT-POSITIVE-INFINITY)
0.0
;;; ev67, same cmucl binary and core
* (sqrt SINGLE-FLOAT-POSITIVE-INFINITY)
#.EXT:SINGLE-FLOAT-POSITIVE-INFINITY
</pre>

<p>So, if the CMUCL people used an ev6 or later, that would explain
why they haven't seen a problem with this, and reassure me that they
haven't dealt with it using some deep magic that I am too dumb to
understand.  All's well that ends well, I guess.  Nobody on cmucl-imp
answered my questions, but I don't know if they have any Alpha hackers
working on it these days.  There's no Alpha 18c or 18d, which I would
view as an indication against
