<p>"The suspend is killing me", said Arthur testily.

<p>Actually, the suspend is a lot better than it was.  It seems that
the good bits of Suspend 2 are supposed to be being read by other
people and slowly merged into the less-featureful swsusp code in the
baseline kernel.  So I decided to try that and see how far it's got,
and it already works better than suspend2 did.  My usb phone is still
broken, but after <a

investigation</a> and a fairly brutal patch I have suspendable
wireless at least.
