I've just spent the last hour reading the SBCL generational garbage
collector in Borders' cafe, while thinking "I'm getting remarkably
good battery life here".  Too late I realise that I'm looking at the
wrong percentage figure in the emacs mode line - that 91% is a measure
of how much I've read, not how many of the electicity beans I've
retained.  That would be 42%.  Doh
