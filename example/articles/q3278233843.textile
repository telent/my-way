I should say a few words about futexes.  Adding futex support to sbcl
(using <tt>sys_futex</tt>, counting semaphores be damned) was mostly a
straightforward job taking a couple of afternoons.

<p>Unfortunately, it seems to have exposed a bug somewhere in GC
handling or stopping-the-world issues around GC.  GC itself is wrapped
in a <b>without-interrupts</b>, which uses a mechanism very similar to
<a href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2003/9/#28.5880"
>pseudo-atomic</a> to delay incoming signals: when the cleanup from
without-interrupts detects that a signal was supposed to have
happened, it calls <tt>int 3</tt>, and the SIGTRAP handler then runs
the handler for the stored signal.  At least, that's how it's supposed
to work.  Right now it looks like the kernel has decided that the
SIGTRAP can't be delivered to the process in the normal fashion and
instead it would be a good idea to SIGKILL all of our threads.  This
is probably some kind of stack corruption.  Attaching a debugger to
the right thread in the right place may be interesting.
