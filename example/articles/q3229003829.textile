<p> <b>Do you ever get angry?</b>

<p> Do you ever get so angry that sometimes your face reddens, your
fists involuntarily clench, your stomach tightens, the vein on your
forehead starts throbbing, your pupils narrow, and a small pool of
blood wells up in your eye socket and trickles down your cheek?

<p> If so, <i>seek professional help</i>.  Especially about the bit
with the blood.  That's just gross.

<p> The rest of you can take this short test:

<ol>
<li> Think of an integer between 0 and 100 inclusive
<li> Double it and add 7
<li> Shut your eyes
<li> If you can still read step 4, you're probably cheating
</ol>

<p>Users of text-to-speech systems, Braille interfaces, and other
web interfaces that don't involve the usual photon stuff are exempt
from this diagnosis.
