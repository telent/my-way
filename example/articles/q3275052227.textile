<blockquote>
But this week I've begun asking myself why I hope things might
change. Because it doesn't really mean anything to me any more; I'm
not the cutting age of some kind of technological revolution, I'm just
more roadkill on the information superhighway. And I don't need to
swallow shit from a twenty-something drone in a corporate office
churning out propaganda for the profit factories of Jim Alchin,
Michael Dell, Andy Grove, or Carly Fiorina. I don't need the money
half as much as I need my self-respect.
