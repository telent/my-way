Still no closer to Resolution 7, I'm afraid.  <img

afternoon was stupidly hot, and having managed to lose count of the
number of laps I'd done, get suntan lotion in my eyes, and wear my
back wheel down to the plastic core, I decided I had reasonable excuse
for stopping when I thought I was about half way through.  Turned out
I was nearer 2/3 of the way through, but still.  Better luck in Berlin.

<p>I've been <a

a little</a> with <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/climacs/"
>climacs</a> lately.  Haven't got much further with it than what you
see there, though.

<p>In gadget news, the Zen Micro seems quite happy now it's on
firmware 1.02.05.  The phone is dead, or at least practially useless:
I broke the screen on Saturday when I fell on it (borrowed some 4x100
skates to see what they were like, and tried to crossover turn without
paying enough attention to how long the frames were), so I've returned
to the Ericsson fold with a T630.  It has OBEX, which inclines me
favourably towards it already.
