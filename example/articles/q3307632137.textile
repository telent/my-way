<a href="http://www.cliki.net/trivial-sockets">trivial-sockets</a> now
has (some degree of) support for SBCL, CMUCL, CLISP and Allegro.  I
don't have a machine readily to hand on which I can run OpenMCL
(actually I have an imac and two broken G3 powermacs, but none of
them are plugged into anything) but its socket interface looks pretty
similar to ACLs, so I'm sure it won't be hard to add that one.  ABCL
would be a nice addition, if anyone feels like it.
