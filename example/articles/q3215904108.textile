<p> The <a href="http://users.ox.ac.uk/~byzance/">Oxford Byzantine
Society</a> were showing slides of their visit to Constantinople this
September; trotted along on the promise of wine and mince pies.  Given
that this is an English November, it may be excusable that the
impression I took away was mostly of sunlight and blue skies.

<p> We (not the society; a bunch of friends) went to Istanbul back in
April, so I recognized some of the pictures.  It would be nice to be
outdoors again.  At a cafe, with a coffee, by the Hippodrome,
listening to the muezzins call the faithful to prayer.

<p> After slides and a post-slides beer, it was time to stick pizza in
the oven and "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in the VCR.  Awesome.  I
wish <i>I</i> could fly like that.  &lt;/orville&gt;

<p> Also today, read Paul Graham's proposal for <a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/arc.html">Arc</a>, a new Lisp.  Has
some interesting ideas, but I can't help wondering if a new language
designed to run server-side applications is not, like, several years
too late to get really enthusiastic about.  More on this later when
I've thought about it.

<p>Day 3 with emacs 21.  Still haven't tried to start ILISP, though.
