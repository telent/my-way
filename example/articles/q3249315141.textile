As an aside I would like to insert a warning to those who identify the
difficulty of the programming task with the struggle against the
inadequacies of our current tools, because they might conclude that,
once our tools will be much more adequate, programming will no longer
be a problem.  Programming will remain very difficult, because once we
have freed ourselves from the circumstantial cumbersomeness, we will
find ourselves free to tackle the problems that are now well beyond
our programming capacity.
