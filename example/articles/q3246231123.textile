Lisp advocates</a>.

<p>I don't really believe that Lisp advocates aren't significantly
worse than any other subculture that considers "you just don't
<i>get</i> it" as a winning move in a debate (ok ok, I'm also a
cyclist, a free software hacker, a linux user and a former amiga user,
so hardly in a position to criticise), but the article is a good read
nonetheless.

<p>I will readily concede that the `solipsist' point is well-made, and
in my defence offer that <a href="/cliki/circle" >cirCLe</a> was
originally titled <a href="/cliki/play+nice+with+unix" >Play Nice With
Unix</a>.  There is no need to be "to be any more isolationist than,
say, Emacs is" after all.
