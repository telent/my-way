<p> Hacking in abeyance today, in favour of starting to clean house,
and visitors.  Visit bottle bank, walk through the university parks
and over to Marston, then back for coffee.  Then we went out for
dinner to celebrate the first anniversary of my vanity company.
Tomorrow more cleaning (received notice that landlord is coming round
to inspect the place sometime during the week when I'm out, causing me
to look at the skirting boards and think "hmm, when did I last dust
<i>that</i>?") and hopefully some writing of invoices.  The company
first traded on Dec 31 last year, but I'm hoping that I can actually
close the accounts at the end of November to coincide with the VAT
return.

<p> Now let's see if we can finish a roadmap for the next stage of
SBCL threads before bedtime.  The thread switching primitives work
fine (and have for months, in fact) so we just(tm) have to worry about
writing a scheduler, queueing, locking, timer events, and doing enough
integration into the stream io system that the thing will still
actually run.  Preferably without rendering the whole thing completely
unusable for people who elect <i>not</i> to use threads, too.
