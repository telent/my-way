<p> As I was shuffling piles of stuff from one place to another around
the house last night, I found the book that I'd forgotten I bought on
Saturday.  "Cosmonaut Keep", Ken MacLeod.  I have this weird feeling
that he's taking the piss somewhat:

<blockquote>
<p>"What's with the fucking news", someone's saying [...] "I can't
get CNN, can't even get Slashdot ..."

<p>This particular clique aren't all programmers.  Sometime half a
century ago, back in the nineties, their social circle overlapped that
of the Scottish literary intelligentsia.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm
<ol>
<li> Is this man an EdLUG member?  I think we should be told
<li>If people are still reading Slashdot in 2045, I want a new career now,
please.  That's just too grim.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Still, I laughed.
