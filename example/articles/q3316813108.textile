<p>I don't think I've mentioned skating yet all year.  Well, I've been
skating.  Lots.  Um.  I joined the <a
href="http://www.londonspeedskaters.com/" >Londonskaters Speed
Team</a>, so some of that skating could even be dignified with the
name "training".

<p>Here, in case you cared, are two graphs derived (by gpsman: I
haven't resuscitated gpskate yet as I want to get a working threaded
sbcl on my dekstop for it first) from my gps data on evenings last
week:

<p><img src="http://ww.telent.net/loop20050204.png"><br> This is a
so-called "Long Slow Skate" from last Wednesday: ten laps of a loop
concentrating on different aspects of technique on each lap.  You only
see 9 and a half here as the gps is slow to get a fix while moving,
and it was too cold to stop.

This is the log from marshalling the <a href="http://www.lfns.co.uk"
>Friday Night Skate</a> two days later.  

<p>You will observe 
<ul>

<li> that something is putting these in the wrong timezone, as both
started at 20:00, not 21:00.  Doesn't seem to be a problem with the
data at least as far as the gpx file goes: maybe gpsman thinks it's in
France.

<li> the effect of skating on roads with tall buildings both sides -
the signal drops out in places, and there are some odd spikes in
others.  The big triangular section at 20:45 on Friday was probably
the half time break.

<li> that most of marshalling a street skate is a matter of repeatedly
overtaking the skate, blocking a side road or junction, waiting for
the skate to go past, and repeating.  Stop go stop go stop go.

</ul>
