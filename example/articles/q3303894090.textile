cvs.telent.net repository archive is now at <a
href="http://ftp.linux.org.uk/~dan/telent-cvs.tar.gz"
>http://ftp.linux.org.uk/~dan/telent-cvs.tar.gz</a>.  Latest news on
the return of the machine itself is that next Friday is most likely;
this is a temporary measure for people desperate to get stuff before
then.  Sorry for the delay.
