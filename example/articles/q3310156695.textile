Pet peeve (skating-related): use of the phrase "concrete jungle".
It's not a jungle and shares very few characteristics with same, and
it's mostly not even concrete.  It's lazy writing.  Stop it.

<p>(If you thought I was going to talk about the rash of legal threats
that seem to be buzzing around the London skating scene lately, well,
you're wrong.  Apart from anything else I am still not fully unhalt,
and that makes me cranky, easily irritated, and prone to spend time
picking fights in online forums, none of which contributes to sensible
and dispassionate discussion.  So, I'll carry on annoying people on #lisp instead)
