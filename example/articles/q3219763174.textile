<p> So, SBCL PPC.  Decided that the easiest way to solve all the
problems with closures and so on was to rewrite the function calling
code to work just like the Alpha code does.  So, done that, now
finding out what breaks.  (So far, everything, but that was an
off-by-one error)

<p> An SBCL rebuild is not the thing my computer is fastest at.
Expect to see more diary entries in the near future while I wait for
builds, I guess.  In the meantime, Nathan Froyd sent me a patch for
db-sockets that needs applying.   Lispers are the <i>best</i> kind of
users - they're just rare (some claim mythical)
