I hate hardware.  Anyonme who's ever had to share an IRC channel or an
office with me will know this is not news.  My new keyboard works;
this is good.  On the other hand, my new laptop memory is actually the
<i>wrong physical size</i> to fit in the laptop - not sure how I
managed to screw that up - and my old desktop has decided that
previously manageable tasks such as e.g. running gcc or building SBCL
are now too complicated to manage in one go, presumably hoping that
I'll pander to its laziness and just restart after the first random
signal 11.

<p>Although I would of course like to replace this boxful of flakitude
with something that doesn't involve hardware in any way shape or form,
I reluctantly have to accept that this is not going to be possible.
So, am making the best of a bad job: arriving next week is an Athlon
64 and allegedly compatible motherboard and memory for it.  In the
unlikely event that it works, this may even provide the impetus I need
to finish the SBCL AMD64 port.

<p>Leg still mending.  Better than it was, not as good as it ought to
be be: with luck, should be skateable again sometime next week.
