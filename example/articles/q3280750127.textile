Daniel

Your job seeking status is set as 'Seriously Looking', but you haven't interacted with your iProfile for over a month!

We've taken this to mean that you're no longer looking for work, so we've changed your job seeking status to 'Not Currently Looking!'

Thank you for your proactive status management!  Your iProfile service
lists "skills" and years of experience with each!  It is less than a
year since I filled the form out!  Therefore I have not needed to
interact with it!
