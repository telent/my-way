Remember what I said <a
href="http://ww.noetbook.telent.net/diary/2003/12/#21.51382" >before
Christmas</a> about GC frobbing?  With the new simpler region allocation
policy described there, but no changes to static space usage :

<pre>
* (time (dotimes (i 400) (gc)))

Evaluation took:
                 30.413 seconds of real time
                 30.354383 seconds of user run time
                 0.058991 seconds of system run time
                 0 page faults and
                 4939776 bytes consed.
NIL
</pre>

and in fact we can easily double that again by disabling the check for
read-only objects and dumping <i>everything</i> in static space, so it
looks like the write barrier stuff does make a difference.  So why is
CMUCL doing in 13 seconds what takes us 30 (the easy answer is "it has
a better object/region allocation policy", obviously, but better why?)
and how much faster would it be if it were also to remove
purify-into-static-space?

<p>In happier news, while thinking about tidying up today I found a
Brian Aldiss novel I apparently haven't read yet.
