There are people (well, there's one particular person using an RSS
aggregator called <b>rawdog</b>) grabbing the rss feed for my rambles
<i>every twenty minutes</i>.  Right through the night, too.  Which
seems a trifle excessive to me, but hey, it's getting a 304 every
time, so no big deal.

<p>Means I probably should tweak the <a href="http://www.analog.cx/"
>Analog</a> configuration, though, if I want its lovely statistics to
be at all meaningful.
