There are two reasons I'm showing you <a
href="/mcclim-no-cpu.png">this screenshot</a>.  The other one (besides
that the McCLIM Listener looks really cool and any excuse to take
pictures of it is a good one) is that it's (i) running in SBCL, (ii)
running usably fast, (iii) not eating all the CPU in an idle loop.

<p> Ingredients: an SBCL that understands SB-FUTEX, running on a
Linux kernel that supports futexes.  A McCLIM patched with 
<a href="http://clim.mikemac.com/mail/0307/2575.html">this patch</a>
(and see <a href="http://clim.mikemac.com/mail/0307/2574.html" >this
message</a> as well for the context).  Some random frobbing.

<p> I sort of wrote a condition variable implementation for CMUCL as
well, but it's utterly untested - and frankly, unlikely to work, given
that despite lying in bed this morning for three hours carefully doing
nothing I still didn't actually get any sleep.
