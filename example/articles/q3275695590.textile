While I'm in this "if it moves, curse it" state of mind, I may as well
give a shout out to vmware.  I press ^L in less and it spends a minute
repainting the screen: it's slower than windows telnet.  I
<i>think</i> the guest system may be running in some silly framebuffer
mode, which is probably not helping.

<p>More obviously silly is their decision to supply the vmware tools
only as a fake cdrom, so that you can't install them in a guest that's
running a live cd image, because it always installs the cd with the
tools as the first cdrom device.
