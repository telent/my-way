<p>One google search I wish I'd done a few days ago is for <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dabs+returns" >"dabs
returns"</a>.  Now I have to attempt to get my refund or replacement
item from a company that has (a) no customer service telephone number,
(b) an average 1-2 day turnaround on email: I'm <i>not</i> expecting
this to get resolved soon.  

<p>Off to Paris tomorrow (work trip).  I was somewhat annoyed when
this trip was arranged as it didn't involve a Friday away, hence no
opportunity for <a href="http://www.pari-roller.com/?lang=en" >Pari
Roller</a>.  Every cloud etc etc though: but I tried my skates on
yesterday and got about ten feet across the carpet before deciding
that it was too painful still to be entirely a sane idea - so, maybe
that's not so bad.  Normal walking around is now pretty much fine, but
the boot presses into my leg exactly where the sore spots are (this is
probably not a coincidence) making any robust attempt at a sideways
push into an exercise in ocular irrigation.
