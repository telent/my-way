title: So, progress on SBCL PPC

<p> So, progress on SBCL PPC.  Turns out to be an assembler routine
which was jumping into the middle of EQL instead of starting at the
beginning. EQL expects to use 16 bytes of number stack; by joining
half way through we were omitting to allocate it, but freeing it as
normal.

<p> Why we were jumping into the middle of EQL, I don't know.  The
assembler routines were calculating their offsets in a way that would
have been correct if static-function-offset did what its docstring
says it should have done.  However it doesn't, and various other stuff
(basically, the generation of cold-sbcl.map) seems to depend on it
working as implemented
<pre>

-  (inst j code-tn
-       (- (* function-code-offset word-bytes) function-pointer-type))
+  (inst j code-tn 0)
+;;     (- (* function-code-offset word-bytes) function-pointer-type))
</pre>

<p>Now we have some problem with EQUALP instead, which will probably
turn out to be related.  From my cvs log entry: "I'm always reluctant
to claim that code found in cmucl could not possibly have worked.
Still not sure how this did, though. "
