<p> Looking at the price of guitar <a
href="http://www.line6.com/Main/Products/productgroups/ProductGroup_Knows.cfm?GroupID=5&CFID=648765&CFTOKEN=72348717"
>effects pedals</a>.  £220 for a nice modelling delay pedal, same
again for distortion ...  Alternatively, £500 for another computer and

>CLM</a> or <a href=" http://www.lakewoodsound.com/csound/"
>csound</a> or similar, maybe £40 for a broken pedal from ebay to gut
for the user interface, I get to design my own effects (I'm not yet
