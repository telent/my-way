cvs.telent.net is down at least until I return to work and sweet-talk
someone into kicking it hard - which I hope will be tomorrow, but
depends on when I wake up and how I feel at that time.  I'm certainly
feeling better today than yesterday, but otoh I said the same on
Monday wrt Sunday, so let's not make any hasty assumptions.  Apologies
to any CLX/cliki/araneida hackers with stuff queued.
