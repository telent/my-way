A month or so ago I <a
href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2004/8/#6.31005" >remapped my
keyboard</a> to swap control and caps lock, in the hope of reducing
the unpleasant sensation I was getting in my wrist when chording
control key sequences.  Shortly after mentioning this to my boss, my
work machine suddenly acquired a so-called "Natural Keyboard", so it's
hard to tell exactly what difference which change made.  Of course,
that evening I went out and stacked skating which didn't really help
any effort to determine cause and effect either.  But anyway.

<p>Having rather more recently got my desktop machine at home working
again (needed new hard disk, and some furniture shuffling to create a
space to use it) I find that the split keyboard really does make a
difference to my typing comfort, and have had to order one.  Sigh.
So, if anyone's keeping track, please cons another on the "I hate all
Microsoft software but they do make (or OEM, whatever) some nice
hardware" list.
