I've been working on and off (mostly off) lately on a replacement for
the <a href="/lisp/howto.html">terribly outdated CMUCL HOWTO</a>, and
I think there's probably enough in it now that people might find it
useful even though it's clearly unfinished.  

<p><a href="/lisp/according_to/">...according to</a> is an unofficial
Getting Started guide to SBCL on Linux.  Comments welcome.

<p>In other news, I seem to have disposed of the useless parent thread
in multithreaded SBCL builds, so now it will only show up once in
<tt>ps</tt> instead of twice.
