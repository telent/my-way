<p> Lately we've been playing the exciting game called "hey, how about
actually <i>reading</i> the specs".  

<p> Last night I found out that the cookie handling in <a
href="/cliki/">CLiki</a> was putting spaces in cookie data (it
shouldn't).  Anyone who has mysterious \ characters appended to their
username probably wants to delete their cookies for ww.telent.net and
try again.  It seems to only show up with reasonably recent Galeon and
Mozilla browsers, which conveniently enough are the ones that you can
delete cookies in without farting around editing cookies.txt by hand.
So, good.

<p>This afternoon I found that net.telent.date's so-called
UNIVERSAL-TIME-TO-RFC-DATE function isn't, because it should be
printing a timezone (it's guaranteed to be GMT, but apparently needs
to be printed anyway).  Having made that change (though not in the
released version, for which I still need to do other stuff first), the
Apache proxy actually starts caching as God intended, and suddenly the
pages/second count as seen by apachebench doubles (99 requests/second
on a 4k document on my was-once-cool-but-now-obsolete 500MHz laptop).
Cool beans.
