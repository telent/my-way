I was going to post an entry about end-user scripting of the unix
desktop environment, and how nice it would be to have some way of
remote-controlling the stuff (web browsers, time trackers, cd players,
screensavers) that presently only really has graphical interfaces.
Then I decided that more people would see it if I posted it on
Advogato instead.  

Then I realised that it was basically on-topic for the existing "Cranky
User" thread on Advogato, so I ended up posting it as <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/article/572.html#10" >a comment</a>
instead.
