It's looking a little less frenetic around here now, then.

<p>On Moday I spent some time playing with <a
href="http://sawmill.sf.net/">Sawfish</a>.  The task was to have it
listen to my modem (which lives on my voice line and is only ever used
for faxes or dire emergencies) and popup a window with caller ID
details whenever the phone rings; unfortunately it turns out that my
modem doesn't do caller id anyway, and even supposing it did it's
uncertain that my phone company (NTL, Oxford franchise) can turn it
on. 

<p>I've been using Sawfish as a window manager for three years or
something and still haven't actually tried its Lisp dialect.  Initial
impressions: nice general design, but handicapped by being based on
a lousy Lisp.  Painful development process: dying on SIGSEGV is
<i>not</i> convenient when the window manager was the last command run
from .xinitrc
