Oh, yeah, and another thing.  GC hooks are playing up on some
platforms, including Linux 2.6.  So I installed it on my desktop
yesterday (which is a rant for another time; the motherboard onboard
audio is now painful to listen to) to have a look at.  Th\xce problem
seems to be with hooks that cons.  Likely fix for for 0.8.4 is to
remove the before-gc hooks altogether - they weren't that useful
anyway - and move the after-gc hooks (which includes the code that
runs finalizers for dead objects, so it's worth keeping) later, so
that they don't run until the instance is in a more normal state
(e.g. other threads are resumed, gc lock has been released, etc).
