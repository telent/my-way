<p> SBCL 0.7.4 <a
href="http://www.geocrawler.com/lists/3/SourceForge/1663/0/8752313/"
>released</a> (I didn't do it, I merely report these things).

<p>From the feature list it doesn't sound like <i>major</i> news, but
when there are bug fixes involved it's better by far to get the new
versions out regularly anyway.  Otherwise you end up in ILISP country,
where they're still telling everyone who uses Emacs 21 to get the CVS
version.

<p>(They're gearing up for a new release soon, too, which will be
welcome)

<p><a href="http://www.aa-uk.org.uk/publications/areyou.htm" >Are You
An Alcoholic?</a>.  ``If you have answered YES to three or more, you
are definitely an alcoholic''.  When it asks "Has your efficiency
decreased since drinking?", I have to guess it doesn't really mean
"since 9 o'clock this evening", though
