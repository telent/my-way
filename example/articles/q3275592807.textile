With few exceptions, my language in this diary has tended to be more
measured and less crude than, say, in real life.  Or on irc (yes, yes,
I know that's not the same thing).  So, I'll just say I'm seriously
investigating non-Knoppix options for a live Debian cd (currently
looking at debootstrap, mkinitrd-cd, and discover) and leave you to
fill in the blanks.
