I don't know whether linking to <a
href="http://spammers.chongqed.org/service" ><b>interseo.com</b></a>
and <a href="http://spammers.chongqed.org/translation%20service"
><b>transwell.net</b></a> with the link text "wiki spamming bastards"
will tag them appropriately in the eyes of Google or whether they'll
just be glad of the extra pagerank.  So, I haven't.  But nevertheless,
they or someone attempting to promote their services are indeed wiki
spamming bastards, and though I <i>obviously</i> don't condone
vigilante violence in any circumstances, I should probably advise any
prospective customers of <b>interseo.com</b> or <b>transwell.net</b>
who may have arrived here for whatever reason that the said
<b>interseo.com</b> and <b>transwell.net</b> are risky people to do
business with as sooner or later some more precipitate net citizen is
going to e.g. firebomb their offices.  And then what will happen to
your "top ten google hit, guaranteed"?  My advice is that instead of
using <b>interseo.com</b> or <b>transwell.net</b> you find some
company that's not associated with such disreputable practices as wiki
spam.

<p>Oh, that goes for navisolutions.com as well.

<p>P.S. If you've had problems with these names turning up in
inappropriate places on a wiki you read too, feel free to link to this
