That was very nearly the right answer.  In fact

<ul>
<li> there are a couple of places that write-protect pages, so both
need to check the <tt>dont_move</tt> bit

<li> GC wipes out <tt>dont_move</tt> on all pages at the start of GC,
before running <tt>preserve_pointers()</tt>.
<tt>preserve_pointers</tt> only looks at the 'from' space (after all,
we're not moving objects anyway unless they're in in fromspace), so
when we see these pages again later we no longer have them specially
marked, so we write-protect them as normal.  Wrong.  Having realised
the problem, the solution is simple: only reset <tt>dont_move</tt> on
fromspace pages instead of on all pages.
</li>
</ul>

<p>10000 requests later with no problems, and i think we've got this
nailed.
