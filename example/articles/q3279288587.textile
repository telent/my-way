I am wondering if there is anyone anywhere who's using the define-page
macro in Araneida.  Revisiting its implementation now, it occurs to me
that (a) it still uses the old handler model, (b) I don't understand
how it works.

<p>I think it might be good to set up a mailing list for
Araneida/CLiki users, just so I have some chance of reaching more than
three of them at a time
