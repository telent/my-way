Aforementioned cafe hacking was in Borders on Oxford St (in London),
after a shorter-than-expected meeting with the accountant.  After
finishing my battery and my orange juice (and confirming that
<i>both</i> of my wireless cards work, insofar as the ability to find the
access point for some random local wireless network denotes
workingness) I went off in search of electricity.

<p>Twenty minutes later I was accosted by an employee who told me that
I couldn't plug that in there.  She was perfectly polite about it, and
maybe it is official policy there, but it seems kind of an odd policy
when so many other places (airports, train stations, even the train I
took to London) either tolerate or encourage it.  Oh well.

<p>So I came home instead.
